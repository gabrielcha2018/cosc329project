We are seeking a motivated researcher to join a dynamic, multi-disciplinary research team to support the development of ecological modelling tools to help cities and land managers to better assess and target nature-based solutions to address environmental challenges. The recruited individual will work at Habitat, an environmental research company, as part of their Research and Development department, to support the integration of machine learning approaches into existing multi-scale modeling frameworks to support planning for landscape diversity, connectivity, and ecosystem services. Research will focus on how to meaningfully integrate machine learning approaches and large ecological datasets across scales following sound ecological principles.
The specific research objectives are (i) develop and test a workflow to predict the presence of forest-related biodiversity across landscape in southern Quebec occurrences using multivariate machine learning algorithms (e.g. Multivariate RandomForest, Multivariate Regression Trees, Boosted Regression trees etc.) with large ecological dataset from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and calculated environmental variables (landscape structural connectivity, habitat quality, climate etc). In addition, the successful candidate will be expected to support on-going efforts to (ii) expand the database of municipal level tree inventory data to refine estimations of urban tree growth patterns using neural network approaches, and (iii) work with collaborators to test the performance of alternative machine learning algorithms (i.e. randomForest, SVM, etc.) to support the rapid classification of forest cover and composition in peri-urban landscapes using moderate resolution remote sensory images (Sentinel-2) within the Google Earth Platform.
The successful candidate will be part of project supported by the Ministry of Economic Innovation in Quebec to advance the uptake of artificial intelligence across sectors. They will join the dynamic Research& Development team at Habitat and will be under the direct supervision of Dr. Sylvia Wood, Director of Research and Development, and overseen by our three academic co-founders: Dr. Andrew Gonzalez (Dept. Biology, McGill; biodiversity, connectivity, ecosystems), Dr. Jérôme Dupras (UQO; ecological economics) and Dr. ChristianMessier (UQAM; forest sciences and management). The recruited individual will work alongside three postdoctoral researchers recruited through a parallel project on the ‘Development of a pan-Canadian strategy for the sustainable/resilient management of natural infrastructures’ with expertise in urban forestry, multispecies connectivity modeling and eco-informatics.
Essential Duties: The primary responsibilities of the successful candidate will be to conduct innovative research in collaboration with a diverse group of university scientists and industry actors. The specific duties will include the conception of novel techniques to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches into new and existing workflows at Habitat; report writing, and development of competitive research grants as needed with the supervisors. The successful candidate will also be responsible contributing to on-going projects at Habitat as appropriate.
Applicants must have completed a Ph.D. in a relevant discipline within the last three years and have primary publications in refereed, English language journals, the ability to work cooperatively with the supervisors, and strong organizational skills.
The ideal candidate will have a background in ecology and expertise in computer programming, and machine learning, and experience with management and analysis of large spatial datasets. Knowledge and experience in remote sensing is considered an asset. In addition, we seek a individual with a desire to develop novel methods to assess and monitor ecological change. We value creative and autonomous thinkers used to working in an interdisciplinary setting.
To apply, please send a cover letter describing your research background, interests, and qualifications; two example publications demonstrating your relevant research experience; plus, a complete curriculum vitae and contact information for at least two references to sylvia.wood at habitat-nature.com.
