The Role
FrontierCFO
is looking to add a Virtual Controller to oversee day-to-day controllership services to startups across Canada and the US.
Ideal for emerging managers, your role will be to nurture the relationship with your client base, adapting to their changing needs while they grow, as well as mentoring and guiding team members on how to thrive in their roles.
You will gain insight into the financial needs and challenges of startups at different stages of growth and scale, manage a team of associates, and work with the Virtual CFO to dive into more difficult and strategic issues.
Key responsibilities will include:
- Lead month-end meetings with clients to discuss the company’s performance, variances from the budget, and overall updates.
- Deliver complex advisory services alongside the Virtual CFO on your team, such as due diligence for an acquisition, raising funds, building out financial models, and other financial planning and analysis.
- Mentor and guide the Virtual Accounting Associates on your team in preparing investor reporting, forecasting updates, and cash management analysis.
- Manage the full-cycle accounting for your client base by working closely with the Virtual Bookkeeping Associates and Virtual Accounting Associates on your team.
Who we’re looking for:
- You’ll bring with you experiences like 3+ years in full-cycle accounting or public practice accounting — ideally experiencing high growth in a remote environment.
- You have an intuitive communication style with team members and clients that contributes to our culture of trust, respect, and reliability — especially when working remotely and asynchronously.
- You have proficient knowledge of cloud accounting tools and can apply an integrated tech stack to optimize efficiencies and minimize manual processes (e.g. Xero, Hubdoc, Expensify).
- You have an uncanny ability to organize a high volume of data and information — while maintaining remarkable attention to detail and accuracy.
- You self-manage your schedule, priorities and deadlines in a flexible way that aligns with your team.
- You find meaning in working in a tight-knit team and thrive when collaborating with and learning from those around you.
Interview Process
We take a short but deep approach to our hiring process - there are only 3 steps, but they are all a little more involved than other companies:
- Initial Video Call - usually lasting about 30 mins, you will meet with our People Operations Manager to discuss the role and ask any questions you might have
- Case Study - there will be a mock client request to review and prepare information for a call. This will first take place with someone acting as our mock client and then a follow up to discuss the case study and chat more about the role
- Team Interview - a call with a couple members of the team to have the opportunity to get to know some people you will be working with, and ask questions from people who already work here.
