About Legible
Come join us on our mission to empower and connect authors and readers through open access to a global reading and publishing platform. Legible is making books beautiful and accessible.
At Legible, we’re transforming the world of stories; not just by creating a new and beautiful eBook platform to experience, but by making stories truly accessible. That means being available to everyone, everywhere, on any device, as well as working with assistive technologies, and making sure local and meaningful stories aren’t buried by search bias. Surrounding that, we’re going to be creating fantastic new ways for authors and readers to connect, with features to delight publishers big and tiny alike.
To make that magic happen takes amazing people. Sometimes that comes in the form of someone with untapped potential who needs to be given a shot, who wants a place where they can be heard and engaged, and sometimes amazing people come in the form of those seeking to quietly lead by example, sharing wisdom and wanting to mentor others.
We believe in the value of having a diverse team. Different backgrounds, upbringings, lifestyles, and perspectives make us stronger, wiser, and more capable. If you’re looking for somewhere that wants you for the awesome person you are, and not just what you can do, we just might be the place for you.
Our Community Values: Accessibility, Sustainability, Beauty, and Integrity
Why Legible?
Legible is a startup with a heart - a company that values equity and diversity at its very core; It is a place to grow and experience different areas of the business. We are a small but mighty team, who are just turning the page on a new and exciting chapter of growth.
We offer:
An inclusive working environment - anyone and everyone is welcome at Legible
A flexible working schedule
Great paid time off package, including a paid winter break
A comprehensive benefits package
A multitude of avenues for career growth and change
An open-door policy - you can approach any member of leadership with confidence
Community Values - We work together as a team to better our local and global communities. We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.
“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.”
- Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About Race
At Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.
Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.
How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.
A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, ""That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!"" At Legible, we couldn't agree more!
Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify. You are valued, safe, and supported.
