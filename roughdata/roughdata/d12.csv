About Quora:
The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.
About the Team:
Our small engineering team works on challenging problems every day. We have a culture that's rooted in constantly learning and improving, and our engineers are encouraged to think big and experiment with new ideas. Using continuous deployment, we quickly see our changes in the product and make fast iterations. Our engineers focus on creating polished products and writing high-quality code by designing APIs and abstractions that are extensible and maintainable. As a remote-first company, our engineers have a high degree of flexibility and autonomy. Everyone on the engineering team has a huge impact on our product and our company.
About the Role:

Our journey is just beginning as we continue to build new products from the ground up and tackle exciting challenges at scale. Today, we're working on a broad range of areas to grow our ads product to drive more value to our users and advertisers.
As a manager on the Monetization ML team, you'll lead and grow a team that is focused on generating revenue for the success of the company and mission to share and grow the world's knowledge. To fully achieve this, we need to make sure that the knowledge on Quora will improve and last forever. Revenue from our monetization efforts plays a critical role in empowering us to do that. You'll work closely with other product development and machine learning leaders to plan, prioritize, and deliver scalable, reliable products that delight our users, advertisers and businesses on Quora.
Responsibilities:
Lead and grow a team of machine learning engineers to deliver high-impact projects within Ads, Business Products and Subscriptions.
Mentor and guide the professional and technical development of team members.
Collaborate with Product Management, Design, Data Science, Sales, and Marketing to shape the team roadmap and ensure successful execution towards our strategy.
Work with the Engineering management team to develop new initiatives and improve existing processes across the entire Engineering team.
Work with Recruiting to grow the team, including sourcing, interviewing, branding, and onboarding.
Minimum Qualifications:
Ability to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during Quora's ""coordination hours"" (Mon-Fri: 9am-3pm Pacific Time).

Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto Western Hospital, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and the Michener Institute of Education at UHN.
The breadth of research, the complexity of the cases treated, and the magnitude of its educational enterprise has made UHN a national and international resource for patient care, research and education. With a long tradition of groundbreaking firsts and a purpose of
“Transforming lives and communities through excellence in care, discovery and learning”

The Department of Medical Physics at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (University Health Network) is seeking an experienced imaging researcher to work as a member of their Functional Imaging Biomarker Development team. The successful candidate will work as part of the analysis development team on integration and validation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Specifically, the researcher will focus on robust and automated analysis of large clinical trial data. Initial tasks will concentrate on radiomics signatures and numerical optimization methods in Python with a view to adapt to CUDA in a second phase.
Background:
Germline carriers of mutations in genes associated with familial cancer syndromes (FCS) and family members have increased cancer mortality, and all carriers within a family undergo intensive cancer surveillance, primarily with diagnostic imaging. Due to the rarity of these syndromes, many of these protocols are not evidence-based, and do not screen for all potential cancers. We propose to investigate how circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA, or liquid biopsies) can help screen patients with FCS through development of better radio-genomics predictors of cancer risk.
In this project, the researcher will be responsible to process the imaging data and collaborate with genomics experts to jointly analyze the imaging and ctDNA genomic information. In the first phase of the project, simple pipelines – PyRadiomics and ElasticNet for instance – will be first implemented to investigate data quality and set the baseline for more complex pipelines. In the second phase, deep learning techniques – convolutional neural networks for instance - will be developed to generate new imaging features and combine them with genomic and demographic data. The models will be thoroughly compared to ensure that the increase in complexity is accompanied with a significant increase in predictive value.
Familiarity with the following will be important for this project:
Experience in handling MRI images
Python coding experience
Machine learning concepts relevant to predictive modeling (model’s capacity, risk of overfitting, validation frameworks)
An understanding of statistical analysis.
Required Skills:
Master’s Degree in Computer Science, information science, related field or proven equivalent experience.
Strong Python development skills with a minimum of seven (7) years’ experience, preferably in the area of Medical Imaging
Experience with Algorithm development and software automation
Minimum of 3 years’ experience with GPU acceleration and numerical optimization.
Experience with MRI image processing and reconstruction
Ability to work independently and self-manage within a dynamic team environment.
Experience working with code and project management software.
Excellent written and oral communication skills.
Experience supervising students is an asset
The successful candidate will work in a fast-paced/multidisciplinary environment with a focus on the translation of innovative concepts and techniques to implementation within the field of personalized cancer medicine.
Interested candidates are encouraged to submit a current resume along with a brief cover letter (including salary expectations) online.
Vaccines (COVID-19 and others) are a requirement of the job unless you have an exemption on a medical ground pursuant to the Ontario Human Rights Code.
