We are all tired of waiting in line. With the convenience of online shopping and delivery services for every type of business everywhere, shoppers are demanding the same frictionless experience when it comes to shopping in a store.

The Zippin platform-as-a-service provides a checkout-free solution for all kinds of stores, transportation hubs, sports arenas, business and university dining locations, and any other physical retail space.

We use machine learning, computer vision, and sensor fusion to automatically charge shoppers when they walk out—a paradigm shift in the shopper experience, with no lines.
In August of 2021, we closed a $30 million Series B funding round with participation from new and existing investors including OurCrowd, Maven Ventures, Evolv Ventures and SAP. This new round brings Zippin’s total funding to more than $45 million.
