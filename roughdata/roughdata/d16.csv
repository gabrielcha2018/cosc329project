"Head of Marine Ecology - Dartmouth, NS - Indeed.com","Head of Marine Ecology
Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada
Permanent, Full-time
Sustainable Marine is a world-leading developer of sustainable energy solutions for islands
and coastal communities. The company is currently building one of the world’s largest tidal-
stream energy projects at the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy (FORCE) in the
Minas Passage in Nova Scotia. Sustainable Marine is working to increase the scientific
knowledge and understanding of fish and marine mammal behavior in tidal flows and their
potential interaction with man-made objects including floating tidal energy platforms.
The Opportunity
Marine renewables have the potential to be a major source of clean energy that is almost
completely untapped at present. To meet the UNFCCC Paris Agreement’s 2050 net zero
targets and avoid catastrophic climate change, many consider that it is vital for countries to be
able to harness the reliable and predictable resource of tidal energy in order to displace
polluting forms of generation such as coal and diesel. Historically tidal energy projects have
been barrage based, damming entire estuaries or rivers with associated impacts on the marine
ecology. Sustainable Marine’s solution is different, utilizing innovative moored floating
platforms with in-stream tidal turbines.
Marine scientists, fishers, indigenous communities, government regulators and the public are
all interested in understanding the potential interactions of marine mammals and fish with this
new technology. The scientific consensus to date is that in-stream tidal turbines are unlikely
to have much of an impact on marine ecology. However, work is still ongoing due to the
following:
the sector is at a relatively early stage of development,
minimal use of monitoring equipment in fast flowing, energetic and potentially turbid
waters of tidal energy sites, and
differences between site locations, ecology and presence of individual species.
Sustainable Marine is investing in the development of world-class monitoring and data
gathering systems that are designed to operate reliably in this environment, building upon its
experience gathered to date. To achieve this, the company is supporting several industry-
leading initiatives with a number of collaborators and partners. We are also investigating the
wider applicability of the solutions developed to supporting the development of a sustainable
blue economy.
The Head of Marine Ecology will lead this stream of work, developing systems that use novel
and innovative sensing technologies and data gathering techniques to inform the science of
fish and marine mammal behavior in the unique and challenging environment of fast flowing
tidal streams.
The successful candidate will be responsible for:
Coordinate with local research organizations and facilities such as Offshore Energy
Research Association (OERA), FORCE, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, academic
institutions, external consultants, provincial and federal government regulators and
partners, as well as international subject matter experts working in this field,
Ensure that scientific hypotheses are appropriately defined, peer-reviewed, tested and
reported,
Work with Sustainable Marine’s engineering team to develop and test monitoring systems,
ensuring it is performing as required and monitoring the development of new sensing
technologies that could enhance our systems’ performance.
Manage data gathering, storage and analysis with third parties as appropriate.
Develop advanced analysis techniques to process data. This will include working with
leading developers of automated techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine
learning in order to filter, sort and interpret data to provide near-real time reporting and
identify what requires deeper investigation.
Provide interpretation and analysis of results to ascertain how fish and marine mammals
behave and interact with our tidal energy systems.
Disseminate this information through research papers and presentations at academic and
industry conferences and communicate with a variety of technical and non-technical
stakeholders, including regulators, other government agencies, First Nation communities
and the public.
Qualifications and Experience
The successful candidate is likely to have a Masters or PhD in marine biology, ecology or
similar with a focus on environmental research in the marine environment, with:
Experience and strong interest in marine ecology and fish and marine mammal
behavior and interaction with man-made objects within dynamic situations.
Experience in the development, deployment and operation of environmental
monitoring systems such as echosounders, marine mammal click detectors, fish tag
detectors, hydrophones and imaging sonars.
Proven ability to design, implement and deliver scientific programs with external
partners within budget and timelines to provide clear and unambiguous progress
updates to key stakeholders.
Dynamic leader who takes the initiative and is a strong communicator.
Prior experience with tidal energy or other marine renewable energy technologies would be
an asset but is not a prerequisite for this role.
Application Process
To apply please email a cover letter and your resume to careers@sustainablemarine.com.
All applications will be reviewed by one of our recruiters. If the recruiter sees a potential
opportunity (current or future) that matches your skills and experience, you will be contacted
to discuss your qualifications for a position with Sustainable Marine.
We thank all candidates for their interest, however, only those selected for interviews will be
contacted."

INCEPTION – YOUR MODERN NEWSROOM
The world has changed. It’s faster paced, and we’re bombarded with more information than ever before. For news organizations to succeed they must adapt to the quickly evolving world of social media and find new ways to plan and organize their content.
News productions must also leverage new platforms, no longer is it acceptable to simply broadcast over the air. To reach the broadest audience and be successful, content needs to be produced for all mediums, including broadcast, the Web, and social media. Audiences need to be engaged in a way that was never possible until now.
We need you to become part of the winning team that makes all this possible.
We are a team currently transitioning into an agile workflow and believe in incremental development and continual improvement. We know we’re not perfect and as we embark on this journey, we expect to make mistakes, but also to learn from those mistakes and grow as a result to become stronger, faster, better.
Customer satisfaction is our highest priority, so we are highly customer focused. If that means jumping on a plane and flying half-way around the world to address an issue, then that’s what we’ll do. If that means sticking our heads into a lion’s mouth, well… we won’t do that, but you get the idea •.
We believe in technical excellence and want to create craftspeople as opposed to developers and testers. We think that following best practices, such as TDD, clean code, adhering to SOLID design principles, clean architecture, test automation, and high levels of collaboration among the team produces the most maintainable and extendable applications.
While we have individual specialties, we are all full stack developers. Some of the technologies we work with include React, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Jetty, Ajax, Java, Eclipse, OSGi, Struts, and Hibernate.

About Legible
Come and join us on our mission to empower and connect authors and readers through open access to a global reading and publishing platform. Legible is making books beautiful and accessible.
At Legible, we're transforming the world of stories by not just creating a new and beautiful eBook platform to experience, but by making stories truly accessible. That means being available to everyone, everywhere, on any device, as well as working with assistive technologies, and making sure local and meaningful stories aren't buried by search bias.

To make that magic happen takes amazing people.

We believe in the value of having a diverse team. Different backgrounds, upbringings, lifestyles, and perspectives make us stronger, wiser, and more capable. If you're looking for somewhere that wants you for the awesome person you are, and not just what you can do, we just might be the place for you.
Our Community Values: Accessibility, Sustainability, Beauty, and Integrity
Why Legible?
Legible is a startup with a heart—a company that values equity and diversity at its very core. It is somewhere you can come to grow and experience different areas of the business. We are a small but mighty team, who are just turning the page on a new and exciting chapter of growth.
We offer:
An inclusive working environment - anyone and everyone is welcome at Legible
A flexible working schedule
Great paid time off package, including a paid winter break!
Positions you can grow and make your own
A multitude of avenues for career growth and change
An open-door policy, you can bring this up with confidence
Community Values - We work together as a team to better our community. We are invested in making a difference.
“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.”
- Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About Race
At Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.
Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.
How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrate, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.
A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, ""That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!"" At Legible, we couldn't agree more!
Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify. You are valued, safe, and supported.
To be considered for this position, you must be eligible to work in Canada and pass a background check
Compensation for this role is $75,000 - $85,000 per year - salary is dependent on experience."
