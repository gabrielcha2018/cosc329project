Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

The Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE MTL) team at
Microsoft Research Montreal
seeks to align the uses of computational systems to broader societal goals in the service of social good, justice, and fairness. Our aim is to understand the limits of AI systems and how their deployment in complex real-world sociotechnical systems might adversely impact individuals, groups, and societies. Our team develops both quantitative and qualitative techniques to examine assumptions and practices that underpin the development and deployment of AI systems, and to make these systems more just and transparent. We achieve these goals through collaborative, interdisciplinary research.
Notre équipe actuelle est composée de Su Lin Blodgett, Nicolas Le Roux, Vera Liao, Alexandra Olteanu et Koustuv Saha. Nous collaborons également étroitement avec nos collègues de MSR Montréal et de FATE NYC (y compris Solon Barocas, Alexandra Chouldechova, Kate Crawford, Hal Daumé, Miro Dudík, Michael Madaio, Hanna Wallach et Jennifer Wortman Vaughan), l’équipe HAX et d’autres groupes à l’échelle de MSR.
