Data Scientist - Remote - Indeed.com,"Our Team
Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.
Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn Startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for start-ups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are TechStars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!
Our Culture
Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value
innovation
,
dependability
, and
accessibility
. In our product, we value
simplicity
,
affordability
, and
informability
.
In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).
Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk.
Our Product
Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.
While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.
Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world.
Sound exciting?
You’re right — it is.
About the role and where do you fit? Great question.
About the Role:
After securing their $10M CAD Series-A round in December 2019, and a $21M CAD Series-B in June of 2021, SkyWatch is on the pathway to scale. Reporting to our Head of Analytics, you will be responsible for building upon the foundation set up by our awesome Data Engineering team. As a Data Scientist at SkyWatch, you will use state-of-the-art analytic and predictive methods to help us turn data into business insights. You will work with stakeholders in product, engineering, revenue and our leadership team to measure business performance, provide deep analyses, and predict future trends.
About You:
You have energy, experience and a passion for big data and the process of scaling.
You love working in fast-paced environments and love making an impact.
You are an exceptional communicator with the ability to translate technical concepts into easy-to-understand language for our stakeholders.
You have an excitement for working with a remote team; you value collaborating on problems, asking questions, delivering feedback, and supporting others in their goals.
Technical Arsenal:
You have a solid understanding of data science tools and libraries (Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Spark)
You have experience with applied statistical methods, modelling and machine learning (regression, clustering, survival analysis, decision trees, neural networks, etc.)
You have strong software development fundamentals and are comfortable developing and scaling ELT pipelines
You understand AB Testing and the statistics which underpin the process
You have experience creating success criteria and metrics for products with an emphasis on measuring what's important
You are able to clearly communicate business insights by turning raw data into actionable recommendations
SkyWatch is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity in the workplace. We are therefore happy to accommodate any individual needs in keeping with the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.

Data Scientist - Remote - Indeed.com,"Our Team
Let’s face it, the best jobs boil down to a handful of things — getting the chance to work with amazing people in a great culture with leaders who have your back while pursuing a vision that you can get passionate about.
Our team consists of NASA award-winning developers, Earth observation scientists, big data specialists, and unicorn Startup veterans from places like Facebook, IBM, and Berkeley and who come from five of the seven continents. Our leadership team includes the Chair of Canada’s first Space Accelerator for start-ups, an Earth observation veteran who has led multiple companies through IPOs, a planetary robotics graduate from the International Space University, and a petabyte-scale data leader with patents in location AI and contextual analytics. We are TechStars ‘16 NYC and Google for Entrepreneurs alumni. We have a unique blend of space/satellite authorities and consumer application veterans. And we are just getting started!
Our Culture
Culture is the personality of a company. At SkyWatch, our culture is incredibly important to us, and we practice it every day. As a company, we value
innovation
,
dependability
, and
accessibility
. In our product, we value
simplicity
,
affordability
, and
informability
.
In engineering, we specifically value our team’s happiness over unrealistic product planning (People First), flexibility over a rigorous top-down process (Freedom & Autonomy), and improving our overall system over dwelling on unintended mistakes or bugs (Just Culture).
Our mission and values are on the walls of our office. We don’t just talk the talk; we walk the walk.
Our Product
Every day, hundreds of trillions of pixels of our planet are captured from space. With new applications for this data such as precision farming, construction planning, disaster relief operations, and retail revenue prediction (to name a few), the demand for satellite imagery is growing. However, the current process for obtaining satellite imagery is very time-consuming and tedious.
While the number of sensors observing our planet is growing exponentially, we are seeing each of these instruments creating their own unique dataset. Getting access to many of these catalogs is expensive and time-consuming. And once access is achieved, is it difficult to integrate data from multiple sources into one system. And we all know the most impactful analytics happen when large volumes of data are normalized and can be easily incorporated into powerful models.
Using our team's experience in building NASA-award-winning software, we are building the SkyWatch API, a simple way to discover and access the world’s remote sensing data. We are making it easy for organizations and developers to monitor the progress of crops, predict the markets, track ships and airplanes, measure global warming, or create other game-changing applications. We do the data work behind the scenes so developers are free to build the apps that change the world.

"Part-time or Full-time Veterinarian - Kelowna, BC - Indeed.com","Hiking and snowshoeing on weekends; yoga during the week.
Locavore food; wineries and micro breweries around every corner.
Breathtaking beaches and safe urban streets.
And in the middle of it all -
Pandosy Village Veterinary Hospital.
Gorgeous design, dedicated staff and devoted pet parents.
It’s your ideal career and lifestyle.
for Innovative, Integrative Hospital in Kelowna BC
Pandosy Village Veterinary Hospital is a vibrant hospital in the trendy urban Pandosy Village district of Kelowna. Our well-rated hospital is the official partner of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan’s BARK Therapy program.
With 2 (soon to be 3) veterinarians, a chiropractor, a clinic manager and 10 additional staff, we are a high performing team, always at the forefront of veterinary medicine.
We are looking for an additional experienced veterinarian who is keen on learning and growing with us.
Our innovative, top-tier hospital provides nutrition, acupuncture, western and Chinese medicine, laser therapy and chiropractics, as well as conventional surgery and medicine. We will encourage you to follow your passions and develop your own practice interests. This position does not necessitate integrative medicinal knowledge; however, we expect you to be open-minded and willing to broaden your horizons, to incorporate holistic medicine into your practice.
Currently our veterinarians offer our clients both alternative and conventional medicine depending on the clients' interest and the veterinarians capabilities. Although we do routine surgery, we do at least three times as much dentistry. Our pharmacy is huge, with sections for conventional prescriptions, herbal remedies, Chinese herbal medicine and nutraceuticals.
Our amazing base of A+ committed clients
really
want the best for their pets, and we provide the best medicine we possibly can. As just a few examples, we run pre-anesthetic bloodwork for every dental/surgical patient, we do in-house titre testing for immunity, and we offer multi-modality support for all chronic ailments. We also accept referrals from other hospitals, and work cooperatively with veterinarians across Western Canada to provide acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine, chiropractic care and multi-modal support (ie, integrative cancer support.)
You'll never seen another practice like ours - it's a uniquely beautiful place to work. Our facilities are bright, with two spacious exam rooms, a daylight surgical suite, digital dental radiography, and brand new lab machines, microscope and radiography. Our clinic is, and has always been, completely paperless.
Within our warm brick and glass facilities, we also have a high end pet health store, which our staff enjoy purchasing from as much as our clients do. We offer not only the top holistic veterinary brand, but also several high quality, balanced AAFCO-certified dry, canned and fresh frozen brands, and a carefully curated selection of nutraceuticals, supplements and remedies. These nutritional tools are a huge asset in preventative medicine and treatment.
Our culture is warm, caring, family- and health-focussed. Our 10+ staff members all enjoy walking and biking to work, hiking on the weekends, doing yoga and cooking healthy food. Our clinic has an informal, relaxed atmosphere. We have a flat management structure, with a clinic manager guiding medical and admin teams. Our staff is incredibly well-educated, and not only the registered technicians! Many of our non-vet staff have taken advanced training in nutrition, laser therapy, and other special areas of interest, such as dentistry and acupuncture.
As we are growing our practice to keep up with demand, this position can be part- or full-time, for 2-5 days a week. The job will begin as soon as we find the right veterinarian. Compensation is competitive, using a base + performance model. All our staff are supported with an alternative transportation allowance, professional development (according to their position and learning goals,) paid uniforms, as well as extended healthcare benefits for our full-time staff’s families. Part-ownership is a long-term possibility.
Work/life balance is very important to us. We rarely work any overtime, there are no on-call duties, and we close all long weekends for family time.
We value diversity and really do welcome employees from all different backgrounds. For the right candidate, we would consider sponsoring a veterinarian not currently practicing in Canada for this position.

Locavore food; wineries and micro breweries around every corner.
Breathtaking beaches and safe urban streets.
And in the middle of it all -
Pandosy Village Veterinary Hospital.
Gorgeous design, dedicated staff and devoted pet parents.
It’s your ideal career and lifestyle.
for Innovative, Integrative Hospital in Kelowna BC
Pandosy Village Veterinary Hospital is a vibrant hospital in the trendy urban Pandosy Village district of Kelowna. Our well-rated hospital is the official partner of the University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan’s BARK Therapy program.
With 2 (soon to be 3) veterinarians, a chiropractor, a clinic manager and 10 additional staff, we are a high performing team, always at the forefront of veterinary medicine.
We are looking for an additional experienced veterinarian who is keen on learning and growing with us.
Our innovative, top-tier hospital provides nutrition, acupuncture, western and Chinese medicine, laser therapy and chiropractics, as well as conventional surgery and medicine. We will encourage you to follow your passions and develop your own practice interests. This position does not necessitate integrative medicinal knowledge; however, we expect you to be open-minded and willing to broaden your horizons, to incorporate holistic medicine into your practice.
Currently our veterinarians offer our clients both alternative and conventional medicine depending on the clients' interest and the veterinarians capabilities. Although we do routine surgery, we do at least three times as much dentistry. Our pharmacy is huge, with sections for conventional prescriptions, herbal remedies, Chinese herbal medicine and nutraceuticals.
Our amazing base of A+ committed clients
really
want the best for their pets, and we provide the best medicine we possibly can. As just a few examples, we run pre-anesthetic bloodwork for every dental/surgical patient, we do in-house titre testing for immunity, and we offer multi-modality support for all chronic ailments. We also accept referrals from other hospitals, and work cooperatively with veterinarians across Western Canada to provide acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine, chiropractic care and multi-modal support (ie, integrative cancer support.)
You'll never seen another practice like ours - it's a uniquely beautiful place to work. Our facilities are bright, with two spacious exam rooms, a daylight surgical suite, digital dental radiography, and brand new lab machines, microscope and radiography. Our clinic is, and has always been, completely paperless.
Within our warm brick and glass facilities, we also have a high end pet health store, which our staff enjoy purchasing from as much as our clients do. We offer not only the top holistic veterinary brand, but also several high quality, balanced AAFCO-certified dry, canned and fresh frozen brands, and a carefully curated selection of nutraceuticals, supplements and remedies. These nutritional tools are a huge asset in preventative medicine and treatment.
Our culture is warm, caring, family- and health-focussed. Our 10+ staff members all enjoy walking and biking to work, hiking on the weekends, doing yoga and cooking healthy food. Our clinic has an informal, relaxed atmosphere. We have a flat management structure, with a clinic manager guiding medical and admin teams. Our staff is incredibly well-educated, and not only the registered technicians! Many of our non-vet staff have taken advanced training in nutrition, laser therapy, and other special areas of interest, such as dentistry and acupuncture.
As we are growing our practice to keep up with demand, this position can be part- or full-time, for 2-5 days a week. The job will begin as soon as we find the right veterinarian. Compensation is competitive, using a base + performance model. All our staff are supported with an alternative transportation allowance, professional development (according to their position and learning goals,) paid uniforms, as well as extended healthcare benefits for our full-time staff’s families. Part-ownership is a long-term possibility.
Work/life balance is very important to us. We rarely work any overtime, there are no on-call duties, and we close all long weekends for family time.
We value diversity and really do welcome employees from all different backgrounds. For the right candidate, we would consider sponsoring a veterinarian not currently practicing in Canada for this position.

What should we call you (maybe it's a short form of your name)?
What are your pronouns?
Is there anything about Legible that you connect with?

About Legible
Come join us on our mission to empower and connect authors and readers through open access to a global reading and publishing platform. Legible is making books beautiful and accessible.
At Legible, we're transforming the world of stories; not just by creating a new and beautiful eBook platform to experience, but by making stories truly accessible. That means being available to everyone, everywhere, on any device, as well as working with assistive technologies, and making sure local and meaningful stories aren't buried by search bias. Surrounding that, we're going to be creating fantastic new ways for authors and readers to connect, with features to delight publishers big and tiny alike.
To make that magic happen takes amazing people. Sometimes that comes in the form of someone with untapped potential who needs to be given a shot, who wants a place where they can be heard and engaged, and sometimes amazing people come in the form of those seeking to quietly lead by example, sharing wisdom and wanting to mentor others.
We believe in the value of having a diverse team. Different backgrounds, upbringings, lifestyles, and perspectives make us stronger, wiser, and more capable.

Our Community Values: Accessibility, Sustainability, Beauty, and Integrity
Why Legible?
Legible is a startup with a heart - a company that values equity and diversity at its very core; It is a place to grow and experience different areas of the business. We are a small but mighty team, who are just turning the page on a new and exciting chapter of growth.
We offer:
An inclusive working environment - anyone and everyone is welcome at Legible
A flexible working schedule
Great paid time off package, including a paid winter break
A comprehensive benefits package
A multitude of avenues for career growth and change
An open-door policy - you can approach any member of leadership with confidence
Community Values - We work together as a team to better our local and global communities. We are invested in making a positive difference in the world.
“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.”
- Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About Race
At Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.
Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist.
How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs.
A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, ""That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!"" At Legible, we couldn't agree more!
Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify. You are valued, safe, and supported.

Duties
The Targeted Geoscience Initiative (TGI) is a national, collaborative, multidisciplinary geoscience research program of the GSC that aims to improve mineral exploration effectiveness by developing next-generation geological models and knowledge, as well as leading-edge tools and methods. It seeks to understand the processes that formed Canada’s mineral deposits and identify and develop novel indicators and parameters to guide exploration in emerging and existing mining areas. TGI has particular interest in critical and economically important minerals, as well as digital geoscience and disruptive technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) to support ore system studies.
This project involves the study of the NRCan ArcticDEM (Digital Elevation Model) in support of a GEM-GeoNorth Activity for a new Glacial Map of Northern Canada. The study will begin by application of various statistical and machine-learning techniques to map glacial landforms by morphotype in various glacial terrain conditions (e.g., soft vs. hard bedded terrain) of northern Canada. Different regions of Canada will be used as ‘test areas’ with an eventual focus on southern Baffin Island. There is no fieldwork planned for this M.Sc. thesis, but it will feed into a much larger Geo-GeoNorth research program for all of northern Canada.
TGI/GEM has opportunities for students to be involved in program research through types of positions: field-based, laboratory-based, office-based, and multidisciplinary. The duration of positions will vary in length depending on specific project requirements.
Field-based positions: Some student positions will involve field work. Field seasons can vary in length and field accommodations may be at existing mine sites or in remote locations in tents with rudimentary conveniences. Work conditions will be variable depending on local circumstances. Field work may include foot traverses or work in cores shacks (mine sites) but details of any required field work will be discussed with potential candidates. Various modes of field transport may include 4x4 trucks, all-terrain vehicles, and/or small fixed-wing and/or rotary aircraft.
Laboratory and office-based positions: These roles are focused on supporting TGI/GEM research analyses by carrying out geochronological or geochemical analyses, 3D geophysical modelling, data integration, GIS, artificial intelligence, and related fields. GIS work may include database construction and data compilation, management and interpretation in support of enhancing geoscience knowledge of ore deposit systems. Students working in GSC laboratories and offices will be responsible for their own living expenses and accommodations.
These positions would involve field, laboratory, and office components. These are most often available through RAP bursaries for students based at a university and conducting research as part of a TGI/GEM study.
Depending on the position, study specializations can be very narrow or very broad. The student should clearly indicate in their cover letter the research areas where they possess knowledge (degree) or experience to allow matching to more specific research positions that may be filled as part of this RAP process. Areas of study that are relevant to TGI/GEM include, but are not limited to:
