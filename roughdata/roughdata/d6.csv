Winter 2022 Recruitment (January - April)
Job Title
: Medventions Intern/Medical Technology Innovation Intern (Several openings)
The Medventions Internship Program is a fast-paced, project-based training structure for students and recent graduates with a passion for entrepreneurship and a commitment to improving health care for patients around the world through technology innovation and commercialization.
Over four months, multidisciplinary teams of aspiring medtech entrepreneurs work closely with academic and industry advisors to identify and validate clinical needs, develop and prototype new health technology solutions, and become well-positioned to plan for their commercialization and implementation into patient care.
The physician-led internships are designed to provide participants with an immersive, hands-on training experience to understanding rules of the road of medtech innovation. Participants will become familiar with the fundamental aspects from developing an idea to commercial success, gaining knowledge of the role of intellectual property management, regulatory pathways, reimbursement mechanisms, funding models and business strategy in the successful commercialization of new medical device technologies.
Internships are considered a jump-start for clinicians, engineers, researchers and business graduates who are interested in pursuing a career in medical technology entrepreneurship. Participants can apply their talent to build their own medtech start-ups, lead translational research projects and become savvy experts in various aspects of the medtech innovation process.
Position Summary
The Medventions Program currently has several openings for a temporary full-time Medventions intern. Successful candidates will work in a team setting and will be assigned a strategic focus in a medical practice area, which will guide the innovation process and chart the path and itinerary for the internship. The strategic focus of the winter 2022 program will be in the areas of
cardiovascular interventions and the utilization of artificial intelligence and big data in the fields of interventional cardiology and minimally invasive cardiac procedures.
Position Responsibilities & Essential Functions:
The configuration of the Medventions Internship Program allows interns to get involved in clinical immersion, identification and verification of clinical problems, ideation, and the making of an early proof of concept or a prototype for a new medical device. The four-month internship is divided into three main phases with the following structure:
Phase 1: Clinical needs identification, verification and assessment
Phase 2: Ideation and brainstorming
Phase 3: Concept development, product design and prototyping
Generally, interns are required to:
If circumstances allow, perform on-site or remote clinical observations, perform qualitative research, and conduct interviews with clinicians, researchers, scientists and key opinion leaders in the field;
identify and document clinical challenges that impose a significant clinical burden;
complete thorough analysis for the identified problems; this includes a stakeholder and market analysis, and a study for the disease state fundamentals and treatment options. Interns will also research and consult with faculty and perform literature and patent searches;
develop a medical solution concept that addresses the clinical need and problem identified;
translate the final concept into a prototype — the goal is to use prototyping to create design requirements and generate high-level specifications related to technical feasibility for the innovation under consideration.
