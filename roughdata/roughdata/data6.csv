"Accounting and Operations Associate - Greater Toronto Area, ON - Indeed.com","About Us
Valence is a venture-backed B2B Saas company and our digital platform was created to mimic the experience of executive coaching-at scale. We are the only purpose built software designed to help managers build strong, successful teams where everyone can learn, grow and perform. Our clients are typically Fortune 500s like The Vanguard Group and Hoffman-La Roche.
Working at Valence means unlocking tailored professional growth opportunities through feedback-oriented managers and leaders. Valencers have freedom to independently solve relevant, complex and uncharted business problems no matter the role. They do this by leveraging natural curiosity, resilience and strong desire to see our company succeed. All of this is done with genuine care and concern for each other, and fun - because Valencers love fun!
The Role
This role will sit on our Operations team, focused on supporting the day-to-day business operations at Valence. The role will have daily oversight of processes related to payroll, accounting (A/R and A/P), vendor management, finance, legal, procurement, tax and statutory compliance. This role will be on the frontlines of ensuring compliance with mission-critical fiduciary and statutory requirements, while also balancing a series of competing business priorities. You will be navigating complexities across 5+ jurisdictions, managing relationships with world-class service providers and software systems - some directly linked to our Fortune 500 clients. As a result, you will hold a host of high-stakes external relationships critical to Valence’s ability to thrive. In addition to managing the day to day requirements of our two core entities (US and Canada), you will help carve out the future of Valence’s operational systems and processes as the company continues to grow in 2022.
You
You are a hyper organized and naturally structured individual with an eye for even the smallest details. You know that precision matters - but also recognize the need to move fast and tackle many competing and important priorities. You derive a substantial amount of professional satisfaction and energy from making certain that your internal and external clients have seamless experiences with our back end operations - you go above and beyond to make this happen, if needed.
Startups are constantly in flux, professionally all-encompassing and ripe with failure - in short, they are hard. You inherently know how to navigate these challenges with natural flexibility, grit and humility to become a part of Valence’s success story moving forward.
Specifically, we are looking for someone with:
3 - 5 years of accounting, business operations experience. Ideally you have a CMA or CGA. In your previous roles you have run a combination of fundamental business processes (accounting, finance, procurement, legal, tax and statutory) - you are comfortable with a range of software.
An eye for detail. You are naturally drawn to the details, understand firsthand how getting them right on the operational side could make or break a client contract, tax issue or payroll matter.
A natural sense of discretion. You will be handling extremely confidential information related to our employees and clients. You know how to manage this with humanity and professionalism in a high-stakes environment.
Polished and persuasive communication. You know how to get a diversity of stakeholders on your side through intentional and tailored communication approaches.
A comfort with data. You know how to navigate the slightly-more-than basics of Excel, Tableau, Airtable and other basic data tools to further enable data-backed decision making to Valence.
Experience with best practices and processes. You have some experience with operational best practices and processes to help Valence bring rigour as we grow.
Patience and perseverance. You have done professionally challenging work before that required persistence to realize results. In short, you don’t give up easily.
A palpable passion for Valence’s stage and size. You have clear motivations for wanting to work at a startup as your next professional challenge.
What you’ll get from us
Frequent, tailored coaching and feedback sessions with managers deeply invested in your professional growth and development (1:1s, quarterly reviews, development feedback and more)
Ownership of projects and strategic priorities regardless of seniority in our learning-focused environment.
A chance to build processes, systems and contribute to decisions that are going to directly impact Valence’s growth.
Options from day one, which means you will be on the ownership track right away!
Health benefits from day one including dental, medical, health spending account, Employee Family Assistance Plan and virtual doctor services.
Annual learning grant to support growth and professional development as well as advisor/professional career coaching opportunities.
Work from home support, including monthly stipend, virtual events, flexible work schedule.
Work Location
This is an indefinitely hybrid role, with a preference for candidates located in Ontario. For those in Toronto, we currently offer an optional weekly cadence of in-person coworking at Workhaus, 215 Spadina. We look to gather our Business Team together about every 6 - 8 weeks in Toronto for ‘all hands’ coworking opportunities. The rest of the time our team is working remotely from home, with our support.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive environment where our team members, vendors, contractors and beyond feel valued and supported. We know that our commitment to inclusion and belonging enables us to do our best work overall. We strongly encourage applications from candidates of all backgrounds regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, citizenship, disability, and national origin. Accommodations are available upon request for candidates taking part in all aspects of the hiring and selection process.
