Job Description
Microchip’s FPGA software engineering team develops the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software used by our customers to program Microchip FPGAs. Customers perform their entire FPGA design flow using our software: from design entry, to synthesis, through place-and-route, timing, power analysis, and simulation.
The High-Level Synthesis (HLS) software engineering group develops Microchip’s high-level synthesis integrated development environment. High-level synthesis allows our customers to program FPGAs using the C/C++ software language. Customers who program FPGAs using the C/C++ language are significantly more productive because C/C++ has a higher level of abstraction than traditional low-level FPGA languages like Verilog/VHDL. Customers achieve shorter design times, easier verification, and faster time-to-market using high-level synthesis.
As a software engineer in the High-Level Synthesis group, you will work on cutting-edge high-level synthesis compiler software with a team of industry-leading experts. You will be joining an agile fast-paced engineering team, where you will solve highly challenging yet interesting problems. You will have ownership over meaningful new software projects from inception to development, testing, writing user documentation, and releasing to Microchip FPGA customers.
The software engineering team is based in Toronto. The Microchip office is in the downtown financial core at 67 Yonge Street.
Responsibilities:
Contribute to our state-of-the-art high-level synthesis compiler to generate high-performance FPGA hardware from a C/C++ algorithmic description.
Our high-level synthesis software is built on the open-source LLVM compiler infrastructure. You will develop and improve LLVM compiler transformation and analysis passes for targeting FPGAs.
Optimize the HLS-generated hardware architecture to improve the quality of the generated hardware circuit (Fmax and area).
Investigate complex real-life customer applications designed with high-level synthesis to optimize performance/area and implement new HLS features as required.
Design HLS-optimized libraries for computer vision (OpenCV), math functions, machine learning, and digital signal processing filters.
