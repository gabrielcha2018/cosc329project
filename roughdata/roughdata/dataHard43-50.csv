"Full Stack Software Developer at Taiv - Toronto, ON - Indeed.com","What We Do
Taiv (YC W20) uses ML to make TV commercials as targeted and accessible as Facebook ads. We’re democratizing TV by letting anyone advertise for as little as $300.
Why It Matters?
We think that all ad channels should be accessible to everyone. Right now, only big companies can buy TV spots, plus they are poorly targeted and hard to track. We want to change that and transform a $150bn market in the process. We also share the revenue with the people who own the TVs, which we think is the way that advertising should work.
Cool, But How Does It Work?
We partner with bars and install custom hardware, which attaches to their cable box and uses computer vision to detect commercials in real-time (more about that below). When it cuts to commercial break, we dynamically insert ads that are perfect for that environment. We sell the ads at a premium and then give the bars 30%.

Our Tech
We have really cool tech - we build our own hardware and use a heuristics-based computer vision approach for classification. We’re the first (and only) company in the world that can detect TV commercials accurately.
Our detection algorithm runs on our custom-designed TV box that we manufacture in-house. We have hundreds of boxes deployed and are installing more every day.
