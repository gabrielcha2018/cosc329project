"Senior Site Reliability Engineer - Vancouver, BC - Indeed.com","About Raydiant:
More than half of all new televisions are being sold to businesses. But to use them, businesses either need to improvise (think Chromecast and an old Android, or a DVD player playing on loop) or spend tens of thousands of dollars on racks of hardware and bespoke software. Yes, it's really that bad.
But it's easy with Raydiant.
At Raydiant, our hardware and cloud software unlocks the power of these displays by making it easy to display media (like video or music), information (like menus or flyers), and interactive content (like teleconferencing or whiteboards) at a price that any business can afford.
We're growing like crazy and we need your help.
Founded in April 2017, Raydiant enjoys support and financial backing from top strategic and technology investors, including Bloomberg, Inc., Transmedia Capital, 8VC, Atomic VC, and Ron Conway.

We’re looking for a software engineer who is comfortable writing code that creates infrastructure that automatically scales. That’s what a site reliability engineer is. Your instances should come and go as needed and involve no human interaction. We can list specific technologies but often this all moves so quickly there is no one fixed answer to a problem. We are engineers writing code looking for another engineer who writes code, just with a bias towards cloud infrastructure.
In this role, you will be working within a scrum team, reporting to the VP of Engineering, delivering high-quality, well-architected infrastructure that scales, handling tens of thousands of requests per minute for features and use cases across multiple products alongside integrations with a dozen partners, some of them very large.
This position is located in either downtown Vancouver or downtown Waterloo, Canada with company headquarters in San Francisco, California.
What You Will Be Doing:
Own the design and implementation of infrastructure code and automation for our entire stack
Helps define and extend the core processes used by the team
Implements key new tooling and automation used by all developers every day
Capable of designing and coding significant new infrastructure spanning multiple services from scratch and shipping it successfully without bugs
Able to effectively communicate status and future design thinking in a concise way for a group of engineers collaborating on a feature
Mentors developers on developing and maintaining infrastructure and gathering feedback
Able to break down a design into component tasks and guide other developers on execution
Communicates well with multiple engineering teams and contractors, documenting requests and updating everyone on progress
Learn how to ship massive combined IoT hardware/software releases, live, using one-week sprints and Trello
Engage in educated and exciting technical discussions
What We Are Looking For:
Computer Science, Physics, Math, Engineering, Chemistry or related BA/BS degree
Five to eight years professional experience, working in a software company with the title of Site Reliability Engineer, Senior Site Reliability Engineer, or higher
Raydiant is especially open to curriculum designers and presenter from dev bootcamps
Two years of experience with strong architectural and system design skills in backend technologies such as Go, Node.js, Python, Docker, docker-compose, and experience with multi-container environments
AWS experience, especially with CloudFormation, EC2, VPCs/networking, and lambdas
Relational database experience, such as RDS/Aurora
Authentication experience including oAuth2 and standard LDAPExperience with modern SaaS build services (Codeship/Circle CI/Travis CI)
Deep “git fu”: GitHub, PR process, able to explain what cherry-picking and squash are for
Bonus Points For:
Experience with Terraform
Experience with Go and/or Python
Bias towards coding rather than doing things mannually
Deep knowledge of AWS networking objects and how to use them
Experience with agile development in a one-week cycle using pairing
Experience building automated deployment promotion pipeline (i.e., build, test, deploy) using AWS services
AWS certifications are not very important to us; real-world coding SRE experience is
Perks/Benefits at Raydiant:
Full medical and dental plans
401(k) plan
Monthly subsidies for fitness memberships
Flexible PTO and paid holidays
Be a part of low ego, high-performance team
One of the first 60 people in a very fast-growing company

Responsibilities:
Contribute to our state-of-the-art high-level synthesis compiler to generate high-performance FPGA hardware from a C/C++ algorithmic description.
Our high-level synthesis software is built on the open-source LLVM compiler infrastructure. You will develop and improve LLVM compiler transformation and analysis passes for targeting FPGAs.
Optimize the HLS-generated hardware architecture to improve the quality of the generated hardware circuit (Fmax and area).
Investigate complex real-life customer applications designed with high-level synthesis to optimize performance/area and implement new HLS features as required.
Design HLS-optimized libraries for computer vision (OpenCV), math functions, machine learning, and digital signal processing filters.
