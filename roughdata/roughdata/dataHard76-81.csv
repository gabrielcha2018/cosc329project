I&C domain protocols and standards such as MODBUS and OPC
Design and implementation of control system network architectures
Programming PLCs, HMI SCADA systems such as Siemens, Allen Bradley and Triconex
Specifying field instrumentation, PLC and SCADA hardware, and wiring design
Recognized industry standards and guidelines
Knowledge and/or experience with cyber security technologies an asset (e.g., intrusion detection systems, forensic analysis tools, next generation firewalls, application control, whitelisting, AV, encryption, automated auditing, analytics), and advanced persistence threats, zero day exploits, malware attack vectors and threat intelligence.Since it is recognized that applying cyber security solutions to I&C systems is experience that candidates may lack,a demonstrated interest in the area combined with an ability to learn quickly, have strong self-motivation and enthusiasm for the work, and an ability to pay attention to detail and have good organization skills, will be considered.
Ability to think abstractly and deal well with ambiguous/undefined problems and various types of clients and customers.
