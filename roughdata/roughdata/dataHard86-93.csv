The Applied Physics Branch is a multidisciplinary organization which is called upon to perform assessments of novel nuclear systems from a holistic perspective, evaluating all aspects of systems simultaneously to assemble overall assessments in order to provide sound, valuable advice to stakeholders, decision makers, and other customers.
In order to inform government and capitalize on commercial opportunities, CNL recognizes the need to have a cyber security capability in nuclear industrial control systems. This is evidenced by nuclear cyber security being identified as a priority in CNL’s 10-year plans. Challenges in this area are driven by regulation and which cannot be addressed by simply applying information technology (IT) solutions due to real-time operational requirements and importance to safety of these systems. As a result, specialists in instrumentation & control (I&C) systems and ideally with cyber security expertise are required.
CNL is looking for a Cyber Security Research Scientist/Engineer who has experience in the design and deployment of instrumentation and control systems, as well as a keen interest, and possibly some experience, in securing these systems from cyber- attacks.
DUTIES
Serve as a core member of the cyber security research group, with particular emphasis on instrumentation and control (I&C) systems.
Propose, develop, and evaluate cyber security solutions for I&C systems using a combination of electrical, I&C, and computer engineering.
Support product development of cyber security products and services for critical infrastructure.
Conduct security assessments of I&C equipment using recognized standards and guidelines
Develop methodologies to mitigate vulnerabilities in I&C equipment and applications (e.g., penetration testing, change management, vendor management);
Responsible for software development and systems engineering in support of basic and applied cyber security research in the real-time I&C system domain.
Responsible for guiding the work of junior scientists/engineers or technicians assigned to a common project. Supervision of other scientists/engineers is not usually a continuing responsibility.
Provide presentations to stakeholders and contribute to internal reports, presentations, and technical refereed journal publications.
Other duties as required.

Undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Applied Mathematics from a university of recognized standing, or membership in an engineering or scientific professional organization authorized by statute to establish qualification for membership in that organization.Higher education (MSc, and/or PhD) is an asset.
Have 5+ years of experience in process instrumentation: industrial process control systems including DCS, PLC and SCADA-based systems.
Strong technical problem solving skills, ability to make recommendations on technical issues, and prepare work plans with minimal supervision.
Extensive practical knowledge and hands-on experience with many of:
I&C domain protocols and standards such as MODBUS and OPC
Design and implementation of control system network architectures
Programming PLCs, HMI SCADA systems such as Siemens, Allen Bradley and Triconex
Specifying field instrumentation, PLC and SCADA hardware, and wiring design
Recognized industry standards and guidelines
Knowledge and/or experience with cyber security technologies an asset (e.g., intrusion detection systems, forensic analysis tools, next generation firewalls, application control, whitelisting, AV, encryption, automated auditing, analytics), and advanced persistence threats, zero day exploits, malware attack vectors and threat intelligence.Since it is recognized that applying cyber security solutions to I&C systems is experience that candidates may lack,a demonstrated interest in the area combined with an ability to learn quickly, have strong self-motivation and enthusiasm for the work, and an ability to pay attention to detail and have good organization skills, will be considered.
Ability to think abstractly and deal well with ambiguous/undefined problems and various types of clients and customers.

The Applied Physics Branch is a multidisciplinary organization which is called upon to perform assessments of novel nuclear systems from a holistic perspective, evaluating all aspects of systems simultaneously to assemble overall assessments in order to provide sound, valuable advice to stakeholders, decision makers, and other customers.
In order to inform government and capitalize on commercial opportunities, CNL recognizes the need to have a cyber security capability in nuclear industrial control systems. This is evidenced by nuclear cyber security being identified as a priority in CNL’s 10-year plans. Challenges in this area are driven by regulation and which cannot be addressed by simply applying information technology (IT) solutions due to real-time operational requirements and importance to safety of these systems. As a result, specialists in instrumentation & control (I&C) systems and ideally with cyber security expertise are required.
CNL is looking for a Cyber Security Research Scientist/Engineer who has experience in the design and deployment of instrumentation and control systems, as well as a keen interest, and possibly some experience, in securing these systems from cyber- attacks.
DUTIES

Strong technical problem solving skills, ability to make recommendations on technical issues, and prepare work plans with minimal supervision.
Extensive practical knowledge and hands-on experience with many of:
I&C domain protocols and standards such as MODBUS and OPC
Design and implementation of control system network architectures
Programming PLCs, HMI SCADA systems such as Siemens, Allen Bradley and Triconex
Specifying field instrumentation, PLC and SCADA hardware, and wiring design
Recognized industry standards and guidelines
Knowledge and/or experience with cyber security technologies an asset (e.g., intrusion detection systems, forensic analysis tools, next generation firewalls, application control, whitelisting, AV, encryption, automated auditing, analytics), and advanced persistence threats, zero day exploits, malware attack vectors and threat intelligence.Since it is recognized that applying cyber security solutions to I&C systems is experience that candidates may lack,a demonstrated interest in the area combined with an ability to learn quickly, have strong self-motivation and enthusiasm for the work, and an ability to pay attention to detail and have good organization skills, will be considered.
