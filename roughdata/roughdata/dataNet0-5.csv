"Mobile Security Architect - Ottawa, ON - Indeed.com","Take a central role
The Bank of Canada has a vision to be “a leading central bank—dynamic, engaged and trusted—committed to a better Canada.” No other employer in the country offers you the unique opportunity to work at the very center of Canada’s economy, in a diverse and inclusive organization with significant impact on the economic and financial well-being of all Canadians. You will be challenged, energized and motivated to excel in an environment where we are reinventing central banking, renewing ways of doing business and reinforcing a culture of innovation.
Find out more about the next steps in our Recruitment process.
The Project
The Bank of Canada is embarking on a program of major social significance to design a contingent system for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which can be thought of as a banknote, but in digital form. This project will require us to break new ground. It will take into consideration a wide variety of factors, including policy considerations, diverse partner needs, difficult technical challenges, and the development of a technical architecture.
For further background information on the CBDC program, please refer to the Contingency Planning for a Central Bank Digital Currency background note, Money and Payments in the Digital Age speech by Deputy Governor Tim Lane and Staff Analytical Notes on Designing a CBDC for Universal Access, Technology Approach for a CBDC, Privacy in CBDC technology and Security of a CBDC.
The Challenges
CDBC is a new product category, requiring the design of a core digital currency product(s), in addition to services and supporting systems for which there are no existing examples. To meet the Bank’s policy goals, a Canadian CBDC will need to maintain certain cash-like properties in its function, including:
Security:
CBDC must have the highest levels of security so Canadians can use it with confidence, as they do our banknotes.
Privacy:
While not aiming for cash-like anonymity, CBDC should be highly private yet meet the obligation to be compliant with anti-money laundering and other regulations.
Resilience:
CBDC should continue to work even during electrical power and network outages.
Universal Access:
Regardless of their circumstances, CBDC should be usable by all Canadians, even by those without a bank account or access to a cellular phone, in remote communities not well served by cellular networks, and/or those with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments.
What you will do
Working with the Assistant Director, CBDC Security, Privacy and Resilience in the FinTech Research team, you will use your expertise in mobile and browser security to guide a variety of mission critical efforts that support the design and security of a digital currency product and services to meet both the Bank of Canada’s policy goals and the needs of millions of users, merchants and other partners.

Contribute to the security architecture of point-of-sale terminals and infrastructure endpoints
Collaborate with vendors and partners on security assessments and audits
Identify gaps and investigate new technologies on mobile platforms as pertaining to CBDC
Ensure to be up to date on the latest vulnerability research and exploit mitigation techniques
Liaise closely with, and consider impacts on, other aspects of the system, outside the immediate area of responsibility, in formulating technical designs
Explain and rationalize design choices, especially when multiple options are available
