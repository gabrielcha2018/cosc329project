Are you one of the top Cloud Architects in the world? Were you an early adopter of cloud infrastructure and AWS and passionate about the cutting edge Cloud technologies and trends? Do you love to automate everything that needs to be done more than once? FMATLabs is looking for a Cloud Chief Architect to join our global team. We are looking for team members to help us develop world class software products for the most exclusive organizations in the world. We're a team of top talents around the globe, and continue to grow off our best asset, our people.
You will play a critical role in designing and executing cloud-based architectures. This can range from orchestrating the deployment of centralised environments on AWS infrastructure, fresh design/build work in cloud-based environments like AWS and GCE, or adapting large existing infrastructures to an AWS deployment model. You will be responsible for developing solutions to complex architectural problems, designing and delivering real enterprise-class software products to customers and being a hands-on peer leader of top development resources.
Just as an example, one project includes migrating a large infrastructure consuming over 1,500 machines globally and storing over 5 petabytes of information into AWS. This role will include implementing profound architecture changes to get ready for the cloud, phased adoption of cloud-specific services, progressive removal of legacy technologies, with the ultimate goal of full migration into the AWS cloud.

Overseeing technical quality for the output of small teams of Software Engineers (requirements reviews, architectural reviews, and code reviews)
While showing technical leadership you will still be in charge of personally addressing the most technically challenging issues in the project. We count on you as the key technical person, not a people manager!
REQUIREMENTS :
Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or Electrical Engineering
Expertise in Amazon Web Services. In particular infrastructure services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk & CloudFormation
Expertise in DevOps tools like Ansible, Puppet or Chef
Deep knowledge of network stack and filesystems
