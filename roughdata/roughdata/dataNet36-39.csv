You will author whitepapers and reference architectures that will be leveraged by the SA community, including our partners and customers. You will deliver technical webinars, speak at public events, and file patents for what could potentially be future features/products.
Our Solutions Architects within our team have experience working in the public sector space, building secure and compliant solutions. They also have strong communication skills and technical knowledge: able to impress customers at any level, from executive to developer. Public-sector SAs are also expected to have thought-leadership experience in the sector regarding business, products, and technical challenges. By nature, the SA is an influencer and leader: someone with whom customers are eager to engage.

With wholly-owned companies in a range of growth stages and an ever-expanding investment portfolio, this group jointly serves a global vision to create an evolved world where humanity serves our highest purpose. Our mission is to create and deploy capital for a better world.
PORTFOLIO COMPANY
Our portfolio company is a transformational technology initiative innovating at the far edges of human-computer interaction. We are pushing the boundaries in biosensing, visualizing emotion, consciousness, and wearable tech by leveraging positive and behavioural psychology, physiology, biology, neurology, and technology to redefine how humans thrive in the 21st-century. We are conceptualizing and creating interfaces, hardware, haptics and IoT devices that gently nudge humans out of the negative behavioural loops that result in them sabotaging their best efforts at happiness. By democratizing biosensing and wearable technology, we are disrupting the economics of a failed medical system. Delivering accessible-to-all digital therapeutics that delicately influence mental and biological systems, we are preventing and managing issues such as depression, anxiety, and addiction: significantly improving mental resilience, day-to-day performance, and the lives of our users.
Our goal is to understand human beings in a psychological and physiological way that unleashes people's fullest potential by integrating technology with biology, unlocking the next evolution of humanity.
