"Jnr Cloud Developer (Entry Level) - Officer - Toronto, ON - Indeed.com","Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).
What you will do:
As a cloud developer, you will deploy solutions in the public cloud (e.g., AWS) using configuration provisioning and management tools (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Python APIs). You are required to design configuration templates that are used to provision infrastructure components (i.e., EC2, RDS, EMR, Lambda etc.) in a scalable manner. Once in production your role is key to ensuring that solutions are performant and operational SLAs are maintained.
Develop applications (the ‘thread or if you prefer ‘duct tape’) that enable business and operational requirements using cloud provider services (‘fabric’ or ‘lego pieces’)
Make concepts ‘real’ by telling enterprise architects how things really work versus what they may have seen in a vendor demo
Avoid 2am production issues by building scalable and resilient (‘works the first time’) applications running globally
Make things better by pointing out redundancies and manual steps best handled via your code
Who you are:
Smart and prefer to have other fork your git repos (versus forking some open source project to show commit counts)
Experience using languages in vogue this decade (e.g., Python, Go, Groovy)
Aware of how cloud-centric architectures and technical standards differ from something that runs on a Windows server
Understand what are trade-offs in design and development (e.g., perennial issues around cache validation)
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering
Bonus Points:
Graduate degree in Computer Engineering / Computer Science
GPA higher than the average in relevant subjects and in the last two academic years (if not throughout)
Prior experiences / internships with exposure to developing large scale applications
Have written apps using AWS services (a bit more than EC2 is always welcome)
About State Street
Across the globe, institutional investors rely on us to help them manage risk, respond to challenges, and drive performance and profitability. We keep our clients at the heart of everything we do, and smart, engaged employees are essential to our continued success.
Our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential infuses our company values.

The Bank of Canada has a vision to be “a leading central bank—dynamic, engaged and trusted—committed to a better Canada.” No other employer in the country offers you the unique opportunity to work at the very center of Canada’s economy, in a diverse and inclusive organization with significant impact on the economic and financial well-being of all Canadians. You will be challenged, energized and motivated to excel in an environment where we are reinventing central banking, renewing ways of doing business and reinforcing a culture of innovation.
Find out more about the next steps in our Recruitment process.
The Project
The Bank of Canada is embarking on a program of major social significance to design a contingent system for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which can be thought of as a banknote, but in digital form. This project will require us to break new ground. It will take into consideration a wide variety of factors, including policy considerations, diverse partner needs, difficult technical challenges, and the development of a technical architecture.
For further background information on the CBDC program, please refer to the Contingency Planning for a Central Bank Digital Currency background note, Money and Payments in the Digital Age speech by Deputy Governor Tim Lane and Staff Analytical Notes on Designing a CBDC for Universal Access, Technology Approach for a CBDC, Privacy in CBDC technology and Security of a CBDC.
The Challenges
CDBC is a new product category, requiring the design of a core digital currency product(s), in addition to services and supporting systems for which there are no existing examples. To meet the Bank’s policy goals, a Canadian CBDC will need to maintain certain cash-like properties in its function, including:
Security:
CBDC must have the highest levels of security so Canadians can use it with confidence, as they do our banknotes.
Privacy:
While not aiming for cash-like anonymity, CBDC should be highly private yet meet the obligation to be compliant with anti-money laundering and other regulations.
Resilience:
CBDC should continue to work even during electrical power and network outages.
Universal Access:
Regardless of their circumstances, CBDC should be usable by all Canadians, even by those without a bank account or access to a cellular phone, in remote communities not well served by cellular networks, and/or those with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments.
What you will do
Working with the Assistant Director, CBDC Security, Privacy and Resilience in the FinTech Research team, you will use your expertise in mobile and browser security to guide a variety of mission critical efforts that support the design and security of a digital currency product and services to meet both the Bank of Canada’s policy goals and the needs of millions of users, merchants and other partners.
