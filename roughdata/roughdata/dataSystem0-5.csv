Job Description
The MEOSAR Ground Segment project is involved in the provisioning and combination of two Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminals (MEOLUTs) the exchange Subject Indicator Type (SIT) messages with a Mission Control Centre that has been commissioned to process the MEOSAR messages.
C/S is the international programme that provides both the SARSAT distress detection system and coordinates Search and Rescue organisations that assist persons in distress. Canada, France, Russia, and the United States are signatories of the ICSPA. The current C/S system uses GEO satellites, LEO satellites, and the new MEO satellites.
The current SARSAT system in use at CMCC uses data from the legacy Geosynchronous Earth Orbit Local User Terminals (GEOLUT) and Low Earth Orbit Local User Terminals (LEOLUT). CMCC has been working to upgrade its systems to include the automatic receipt, processing, and distribution of data from its currently commissioned Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminal (MEOLUT) as well as the future MEOLUTs currently being installed. Simultaneously, C/S requirements have evolved to include new beacon types including Return Link Service (RLS), Emergency Locator Beacons for Distress Tracking (ELT(DT)), and Second Generation Beacons (SGB) that must be processed by CMCC’s LGM system.
Currently, the duties of the CMCC SARSAT Software Analyst are completed by a Regular Force RCAF officer as a secondary duty. Due to scarce availability of Resource, and limited knowledge of other unit members related to MEOSAR and MCC data processing, additional support is required to complete the software testing, operator training, and updates to CMCC’s operational processes, and training programs in a timely manner.
The CMCC operates the Canadian SARSAT Ground Segment Equipment (GSE) and ensures that the correct data is distributed to the correct destination within the defined timelines. Canada’s GSE includes three MCC servers (two operational and one for testing) at two locations in Trenton and Belleville, Ontario, as well as four LEOLUTs, three GEOLUTs, and one MEOLUT commissioned to Early Operational Capability (EOC) as defined by C/S. Future MEOLUT systems are being installed to meet the C/S defined Initial Operational Capability (IOC) standards. Further details are contained in the CMCC Concept of Operations (CMCC ConOps).
Due to operations being governed by C/S standards, CMCC traditionally completes all training internally despite no official training program. With the addition of the highly complex MEOSAR components, the training program, CMCC Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and CMCC publications require an update to enable CMCC to move to LGM operations, and generate future CMCC Duty Operators.
The Senior Systems Analyst must perform at least the following tasks:
Review CMCC (Canadian Mission Control Center) related portions of CAMSAR (Canadian Aviation and Maritime Search and Rescue) and the CMCC ConOps prior to the Kick-Off Meeting (KOM).
The Resource must perform the following tasks on an “as and when requested” basis:
Conduct testing and evaluation on CMCCs systems and operators to implement all current LG (LEO [Low Earth Orbit] + GEO [Geostationary Earth Orbit]) C/S (Cospas-Sarsat) requirements at CMCC, primarily the LGM (LEO + GEO + MEO [Middle Earth Orbit]) MCC commissioning testing and related commissioning efforts for the inclusion of Canada’s additional MEOLUTs;
Review current CMCC Operator training and provide recommendations for improvement, including the addition of training related to MEOSAR and all currently defined beacon types;
Subsequent to approved training recommendations, develop and deliver training package to CMCC, and deliver first training session to CMCC key staff as coordinated with CMCC. This first session is envisioned as a train-the-trainer approach;
Review MEOLUT (Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminal) operator and engineering training materials; deliver and provide feedback to the TA or designate;
Assess and contribute to MEOLUT operator and engineering training, and support subsequent development and incorporation of material into CMCC training;
Review CMCCs Quality Management System (QMS) processes, and provide recommendations for improvement, including the MEOSAR QMS (Quality Management System) aspects as detailed in C/S A.003 Cospas-Sarsat System Monitoring and Reporting;
Review key internal and external documents identified or provided by the Technical Authority or their designate;
Provide SARSAT operational expertise and system update coordination to Canadian and international stakeholders, including CMCC unit members; and
Actively participate in C/S meetings in support of the Canadian Delegation to C/S (CANDEL) as they pertain to CMCC operations.
Supplemental Tasks
The Senior Systems Analyst must perform the following tasks on an as and when requested basis
Act as a technical advisor on MCC Operations including:
Monitor and advise the OIC (Officer in Charge) CMCC, CMCC SARSAT Analyst, and the Chief Operator on MCC Operations, Standards, and Standard Operating Procedures;
Lead and participate in unit and national SARSAT related projects as required; and
Research and develop solutions for evolving trends in Canada’s operational SARSAT system, whether solutions are national or international in focus.
Actively participate in C/S activities in support of the Canadian Delegation to C/S (CANDEL [Canadian Delegation]), including:
Prepare for, attend, and actively participate in meetings, working groups, test campaigns, and other C/S formal and informal activities;
Develop, test, and evaluate pending C/S enhancements on Canada’s Ground Segments;
Research and development of system improvements;
Conduct analysis of issues found;

Draft, review, and present papers and reports at C/S meetings and working groups; and
Provide input for Canadian positions, while working to enhance the international system.

"Quality Assurance Analyst - Req 15089 - Fredericton, NB - Indeed.com","Background
Community Finance IT System Background
There are a number of business applications, built in various technologies, which are used by the Department of Environment and Local Government’s Community Finances branch (ELG-CF). ELG-CF uses for these systems to review/approve Local Government budgets and manage warrant payments. ELG-CF is also responsible for the calculation of the Community Funding and Equalization Grants (CFEG).
Although these legacy systems have historically provided the necessary support, they have not been updated or able to meet the changing needs of ELG-CF. These current systems have significant shortcomings that need to be addressed and enable a smoother flow of information between ELG-CF and other government departments that either provide data to ELG-CF or receive data from ELG. In addition, recently announced government priorities are putting emphasize on local government reforms. Changes resulting from those reforms would not be supported within the current system and create even more shortcomings resulting in more manual processes and errors.
Project Objective
The project objective is to deliver a modern Community Finances Information System (CFIS) that will support Community Finance requirements and provide enough flexibility to support evolving requirements resulting from Local Government Reforms. The solution will provide a “back office” solution for ELG-CF staff to support departmental processes and facilitate the budget preparation, budget approval, grant calculation, warrants management and reporting. The solution will also provide an external facing portal for local governments to receive information necessary for budget preparation (templates, grants, tax base…), submit their budgets and reporting.
