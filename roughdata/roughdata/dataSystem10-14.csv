The Strategic Policy division of C+CP has an opening for a GIS Analyst at the Vancouver Campus. Mapping and the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data and applications play an integral role in the planning and development work undertaken by C+CP for both the Vancouver and Okanagan campuses.
