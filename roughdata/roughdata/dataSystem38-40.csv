"Jnr Business System Analyst - Toronto, ON - Indeed.com","Who we are
Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $39 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $3.5 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
Recently we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).
What you will do:
As a business system analyst, you will work as part of our team to analyze business requirements and design solutions which enable seamless interactions across the cloud operational lifecycle. You will also help with improving system processes to deliver the desired experience for various platforms and toolchains.
This role will require critical thinking necessary for diligent research into tradeoffs around feasibility, cost, compatibility, etc. You will contribute to various projects that develop business solutions for cloud environments, including building cost models based on service utilization and creating presentations which define operational workflow specifications and integrations.
Who you are:
Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science or equivalent fields
Strong Microsoft Office skills including Excel and PowerPoint
Outstanding presentation and communication skills
Ability to translate business requirements into technical requirements
Strong logical thinking and analytical skills to design and refine business process flow charts and diagrams
Strong quantitative and numeracy skills exemplified in development of MS Excel model or similar tools (e.g., Anaplan)
Bonus Points:
Prior internship experience
Graduate level program
Experience with AWS or other cloud providers
Relevant experience exemplified by hobbies
Participation with technology consulting or related experiences
