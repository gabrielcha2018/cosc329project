guaranteed automatic
increase after 3 months probation (sooner if you blow us out of the water!)
Hey there! Thanks for clicking (or tapping!).
We're CleaningPros Edmonton and we strive to be the best employer you’ve ever had. We believe we can achieve this because we put an equal focus on our team members, as we do our customers (if the team isn’t happy the customer isn’t happy!).
We try not to forget that we are all human and life isn’t always perfect. Our manager’s goal is to SUPPORT our team members rather than 'manage' (so I guess we should call them 'Supporters' then?).
We believe this is why our team is quite happy (on most days!) in a very demanding industry.
The only hardline our management takes is our ‘no drama/gossip’ policy, which allows our whole team to focus on the work at hand.
In complete honesty Professional Cleaning is very demanding work. It's no walk in the park.
But it is very rewarding and made even better when you have a whole team that works hard (which we do!).
If you have a positive attitude, are willing to show up and give it your best, we want you to apply.
We will teach you the rest! (that rhymed! -we love to jest.)
--------------------------------------
Besides Our Awesome Team & Support Staff, Here Are Some Other Things We Offer At CleaningPros:
*Probation Starts At $17.00/Hour, $18.00/hr automatic increase after 3 month probation
- Or sooner!
* You never work any evenings or weekends
- Our team works Monday through Friday between 9AM & 5PM.
*No Experience Required.
-Training will be provided. You just have to be a hard worker.
*Benefits (health, dental, life insurance) available for full-time staff after 6 months
- If you have a family, they are included in the plan.
*No limit on days off/vacation days as long as 2 or more weeks notice is given
- It’s nice knowing that you can build work around your life.
*Company iPad with cellular connection provided free of charge
- All communication happens through your company iPad.
- Or if you prefer you can use your Personal phone and receive $25/month.
*You keep 100% of your tips
- You got the tip. You get to keep all of it.
*Same wage paid for cleaning time and travel time between appointments
- We pay you the same wage all day. Simple as that.
*We provide you with all the tools and supplies you need
- We have a great professional kit. We refill you each week. You can't do good work without good tools.
*Fuel Rate paid out on every cheque
- We help offset your gas usage on top of your regular pay. Nifty!

Of Course We Are Looking For People Who Are Going To Be a Good Fit For Our Team. Here is What We Will Ask Of You:
