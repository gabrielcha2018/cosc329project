About MRU
Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal University grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university in 2009. Mount Royal has carved out a distinct niche by offering smaller class sizes, a robust liberal education and unique undergraduate programs. Currently, more than 15,000 credit students choose from 13 bachelor degrees and 38 majors.

We are situated on land where the Bow River meets the Elbow River. The traditional Blackfoot name of this place is ""Mohkinstsis,"" which we now call the city of Calgary. The city of Calgary is also home to the Métis Nation.

About the Project

The LMS is a software application that serves as a digital extension of the classroom. It enables instructors and students to connect with one another, and with course content, anytime and anywhere.
It includes a rich set of features and functionality to support the instructor throughout the course design, development, and delivery lifecycle. And for students, the LMS is a central gathering point for their learning, where they can access course content, monitor due dates and grades, review instructor feedback, and more.
In addition, when integrated with the student information system (Banner), course sections in the LMS are automatically created and populated each term with the assigned instructor(s) and enrolled students, performing an essential course management function.
The move to a new LMS is a significant change that will affect the entire campus community. The OCM role is critical to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system. Communication, consultation and change management are recognized as essential elements of the project.
