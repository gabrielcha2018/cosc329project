Nicolas
is a member of the front-end development team – we have a Vick and a Nick, so our next hire will have to be a Rick! He’s focused on programming the logic that goes along with the design… and fixing the third-party text editor again when we find another bug. He’s competitive (just try to beat him in Super Smash Bros) and loves to travel! Ask him about the best ramen he had in Tokyo
Shannon
is one of our fantastic front-end developers whose curiosity and creativity make her a joy to work with! A lover of music, she’s a secret karaoke master who’d love to learn to play ukulele someday.

Vick
is our Star Wars enthusiast and diehard fan of Toronto-based sportball teams! As a member of the front-end development team, he’s focused on making sure that what our users see actually looks and works like it’s supposed to. In his spare time, Vick can be found watching hockey, playing hockey (NHL game series or good ol’ fashioned street hockey), reading books about hockey… look, he really likes hockey okay?!
