Posting
Date Posted: September 23, 2021
The Bissett School of Business at Mount Royal University invites applications for a Tier II Canada Research Chair (CRC) in the area of global value chain. The successful applicant will also hold a tenure-track/tenured position at the rank of Assistant or Associate Professor. The position will commence July 1, 2022, subject to final budgetary approval.
The CRC in Global Value Chain will contribute to the Department of International Business and Supply Chain Management. Our research program is industry focused and is grounded in our BBA majors in Supply Chain Management and International Business. The supply chain major contains 10 core courses, is highly integrated with our CN Supply Chain Data Analytics Lab, and offers a co-op education opportunity. More information about the BBA and IBSC major can be found here: (https://www.mtroyal.ca/ProgramsCourses/FacultiesSchoolsCentres/Business/index.htm). The program is deeply rooted in applied learning, accredited with the Canadian Supply Chain Research Foundation and heavily involved with highly regarded networks in both industry and academic communities.
“International production, trade and investments are increasingly organized within global value chains (GVCs) where the different stages of the production process are located across different countries” (OECD - www.oecd.org). As such, the academic study of GVCs can be from the perspective of international strategy, supply chain management, logistics, and data analytics.
The successful applicant will have demonstrated evidence of a sustained and productive emerging world-class research program. Applicants must present evidence of a strong publication record in global supply chain management, as well as a demonstrated ability to attract peer-reviewed funding. The program of research will be linked to the International Business & Supply Chain Management department within the Bissett School of Business. Research would ideally address substantive challenges in global supply chain competitiveness in a post pandemic world. This should be coupled with advanced data analytics. A long-term goal for this position is to foster multidisciplinary research that links the School and industry, while intentionally integrating an international, intercultural or global dimension into the work and student interactions.
The successful applicant’s research program, while requiring independent work, should also have a collaborative component that will engage and mentor MRU students, faculty members across disciplines, government stakeholders, and industry and community partners. The candidate will be expected to propose an original, innovative research program of high quality that demonstrates the potential to achieve international recognition in the next five to 10 years.
About MRU
Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal University grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university in 2009.
