About MRU
Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal University grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university in 2009. Mount Royal has carved out a distinct niche by offering smaller class sizes, a robust liberal education and unique undergraduate programs. Currently, more than 15,000 credit students choose from 13 bachelor degrees and 38 majors.
Mount Royal University is located in the traditional territories of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot) and the people of the Treaty 7 region in southern Alberta, which includes the Siksika, the Piikani, the Kainai, the Tsuut'ina and the Iyarhe Nakoda. We are situated on land where the Bow River meets the Elbow River. The traditional Blackfoot name of this place is ""Mohkinstsis,"" which we now call the city of Calgary. The city of Calgary is also home to the Métis Nation.
Mount Royal University is committed to removing barriers and fostering the inclusion of voices that have been historically underrepresented or discouraged in our society. In support of our belief that diversity in our faculty and staff enriches the work, learning and research experiences for the entire campus community, we strongly encourage members of the designated groups (women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, and diverse sexual orientation and gender identities) to apply and self-identify.

We began this process with an Indigenous Strategic Plan (https://www.mtroyal.ca/IndigenousMountRoyal/index.htm) and through resources such as a steering committee led by the newly-created Associate Vice-President, Indigenization and Decolonization, the Office of Academic Indigenization and Decolonization, and the Iniskim Centre which offers programs and services to increase the engagement and success of Indigenous students while also raising awareness of Indigenous peoples and cultures.
Tier 2 Research Chairs are intended for outstanding emerging scholars (i.e., candidates must have been an active researcher in their field for fewer than 10 years at the time of nomination). Applicants who are more than 10 years from having earned their highest degree (and where career breaks exist, such as maternity, parental or extended sick leave, clinical training, etc.) may have their eligibility for a Tier 2 Chair assessed through the program’s Tier 2 justification process. Please contact the CRC research grants office for more information. We recognize the legitimate impact that leaves (e.g., maternity leave, leave due to illness) can have on a candidate’s record of research achievement; these leaves will be taken into careful consideration during the assessment and eligibility process.
Once hired, the successful candidate will take up a tenured or tenure-track position in the discipline of Indigenous Studies and will work with MRU to prepare an application package to submit to the Canada Research Chairs Selection Committee that adjudicates all nominations on a national basis. The CRC is tenable for five years with the option to renew once. Upon completion of the CRC the successful candidate will still hold a permanent faculty position. Should the CRC not be approved, the successful candidate will still retain a regular faculty position.
Qualifications
This position is open only to Indigenous (First Nations, Métis, Inuit) scholars.
To be eligible for the CRC program, applicants must meet the following four criteria:
be excellent emerging world-class researchers who have demonstrated particular research creativity;
have demonstrated the potential to achieve international recognition in their fields in the next five to ten years;
have the potential to attract, develop and retain excellent trainees, students and
future researchers; and
be proposing an original, innovative research program of high quality.
The successful candidate for a Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Studies will also demonstrate the potential and capacity to undertake an innovative and original program of research and knowledge mobilization that potentially makes meaningful contributions towards reconciliation between Indigenous and settler peoples. The CRC will be expected to grow research capacity at Mount Royal University through a variety of activities including obtaining external funding.
The candidate is expected to have a completed PhD or other terminal degree or, in exceptional circumstances, an equivalent combination of professional or community experience and education. It would be an asset if the successful candidate possesses a deep knowledge of an Indigenous culture(s) and/or proficiency in an Indigenous language.
This is a research-focused position, but the successful candidate will be expected to teach 1-2 courses/year in their area of expertise and to contribute to the minor in Indigenous Studies. The successful candidate must have a strong grasp of how Indigenous pedagogies can have a positive impact on reconciliation efforts and the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as advance Indigenous sovereignty. Demonstrated ability or experience to engage a wide array of students in Indigenous ways of knowing is sought, as is the ability to connect with a wide range of faculty and staff who are working toward Indigenization and decolonization at Mount Royal University.
The CRC will also be involved in service work that broadens the MRU community’s grasp of Indigenous knowledges and Indigeneity across various disciplines with a goal of enhancing how MRU’s academic programs and activities contribute to reconciliation, Indigenization, and decolonization. It is hoped that the CRC will lead further partnerships and collaborations with Indigenous nations locally and beyond and it is desirable for the candidate to have a record of engagement with and service to Indigenous communities, organizations and/or institutions.
