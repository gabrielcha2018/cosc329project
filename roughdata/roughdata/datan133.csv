About MRU
Founded in 1910 and located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Mount Royal University grew into a vibrant college in the 1930s and became a mid-sized university in 2009. Mount Royal has carved out a distinct niche by offering smaller class sizes, a robust liberal education and unique undergraduate programs. Currently, more than 15,000 credit students choose from 13 bachelor degrees and 38 majors.
Mount Royal University is located in the traditional territories of the Niitsitapi (Blackfoot) and the people of the Treaty 7 region in southern Alberta, which includes the Siksika, the Piikani, the Kainai, the Tsuut'ina and the Iyarhe Nakoda. We are situated on land where the Bow River meets the Elbow River. The traditional Blackfoot name of this place is ""Mohkinstsis,"" which we now call the city of Calgary. The city of Calgary is also home to the Métis Nation.
Mount Royal University is committed to removing barriers and fostering the inclusion of voices that have been historically underrepresented or discouraged in our society. In support of our belief that diversity in our faculty and staff enriches the work, learning and research experiences for the entire campus community, we strongly encourage members of the designated groups (women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, members of visible minorities, and diverse sexual orientation and gender identities) to apply and self-identify.
About the Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts houses the following departments: Economics, Justice & Policy Studies, English, Languages & Cultures, Humanities, Interior Design, Psychology, and Sociology & Anthropology. It currently offers the following degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Arts—Criminal Justice, and Bachelor of Interior Design.
The Department of Sociology & Anthropology currently offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Arts Honours degree programs with majors in Sociology and Anthropology.
About the Role
The Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the Faculty of Arts at Mount Royal University invites applications for a tenure track position in cultural or linguistic anthropology, which will commence on July 1, 2022, at the Rank of Assistant Professor, subject to final budgetary approval. Applicants will have a doctoral degree in cultural or linguistic anthropology. We are looking for a candidate with an engaging and innovative cultural/linguistic anthropological research program. Areas of research expertise are open but the candidate should add to and complement existing strengths in our department; individuals who have the ability to develop courses in innovative and creative methodologies are encouraged to apply. The successful applicant will be expected to teach cultural and/or linguistic anthropology introductory and core courses (including methods and theory). A commitment to decolonial and anti-racist perspectives in the curriculum is a priority.
Our combined Sociology and Anthropology department hosts faculty who pursue diverse research and teaching interests but work collaboratively to ensure the success of both disciplines. In our four-field Anthropology department-unit we emphasize experiential learning, including international field schools, local field trips, as well as ethnographic and laboratory methods.
The successful candidate will be hired into the teaching/scholarship/service work pattern (TSS). The TSS work pattern has a focus on teaching with the requirement that the faculty member be involved in a research program as well as service to the Mount Royal community. The successful applicant must be qualified to teach introductory courses as well as senior courses in anthropology and be involved in course and program development.
Candidates will also be encouraged to teach courses in General Education in Cluster-Three: Community and Society. The Department of General Education is responsible for the development and delivery of the liberal education component of all Mount Royal University undergraduate degree programs and offers required foundational first-year courses and a number of upper-level courses. A Ph. D. in anthropology or cognate discipline is required at the time of hire. Applicants should have the ability and intent to pursue a research program.
