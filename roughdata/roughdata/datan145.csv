"Marketing Coordinator - Barrie, ON - Indeed.com","Who Are We?
Based in ON, Canada, Suits Social is a young, modern, and highly effective digital marketing agency founded in 2015. We've recently gone full-remote and all of our staff now work from home, and can live anywhere in Ontario!
This means two things:
No more commuting in rush hour!
No more filling up with $2/L gas every few days.
And most important of all (thanks to Zoom), you'll only need to purchase nice clothes from the waist up. Just kidding... but not really.
Seriously though, times are changing (in case you haven't noticed) and we're committed to developing a digital first experience for both our staff and clients as we evolve into a new era of marketing and business.
What We Do!
Suits Social works with businesses across Canada and North America, to plan and execute profitable digital marketing campaigns on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Google, Email, etc. Our goal is to help businesses build their brand awareness, generate more leads and acquire new customers profitably online with a system that scales!
Get in on the ground floor of something HUGE!
We are building a world-class team of people who like to be challenged and want to grow into leaders of a nationally known agency. You'll get plenty of opportunity to work and learn from a seasoned team of digital marketing experts, as well as directly with the founder of Suits Social Darren Cabral.
As a newer agency, new roles and opportunities are created every year. That means if you're willing to work hard, put your head down, and get sh*t done... they'll be plenty of room for growth over the next 5-10 years. We're in it for the long haul and are looking for candidates who feel the same. If that sounds like you, we want to talk!
What kind of person are we looking for?
We are looking for a passionate individual with high energy, high intelligence, and an abundance of common sense and/or street smarts. We're also looking for someone willing to contribute new ideas towards the consistant improvement and growth of the company, our processes and our systems.
To succeed at this role you'll need to have a positive can-do attitude AT ALL TIMES, and be a ""likeable"" team player. You need to be able to manage many projects and tasks, and be able to change direction at a moments notice as our agency and clients are constantly changing and we have to be willing to do the same. Most importantly, you need to be self-motivated.
Suits Social is looking for a passionate digital marketer who lives and breathes digital marketing and social media. What we are looking for someone who has experience with:
Facebook & Instagram Ads
Facebook analytics, pixels, custom audiences, power editor, and Ads Manager.
Google AdWords & YouTube Video Ads.
Ability to handle and manage multiple campaigns for multiple clients
Re-Targeting campaigns, building sales funnels, inbound marketing strategy, etc.
Familiar with landing page software like Leadpages, Click Funnels, Wordpress, etc.
Lead nurturing, A/B Testing, Analytics and reporting, and conversion tracking.
Familiar with email marketing software like MailChimp, Klavyio, Active Campaign, etc.
Confident in creating campaigns that will deliver on client business objectives and provide measurable ROI.
Familiar with Google Analytics and other tracking systems.
Most Important of All!
Above all else, we are looking for someone who is willing to go above and beyond their job description when required. (Which is probably going to be often.)
If you need to put together a piece of creative, help another team member for the day, or work on one of our side projects, we need you to be ready and willing. Sometimes your day will run a little late, sometimes you'll have an emergency pop up on a weekend. You need to be willing to play ball and make sure whatever you are responsible for get's done, no excuses.
Basically, we play hard but we work harder. This is not a traditional office job, there is a lot of flexibility and infinite room for growth. You will work, you will learn, but you will have fun! You're joining a family, not a company, and we need someone who truly believes that.
Who We Don't Want
This is not a simple ""follow your instructions and keep your head down"" type of job. It's hard, it can get confusing, and there can be a lot of pressure, if that's not for you, don't apply. If you get offended when someone gets upset at you, or a client challenges your work, don't apply. If you get offended by constructive criticism or feedback, don't apply. If you get offended a lot in general by a variety of things, please... don't apply. We're a transparent bunch, we'll always tell each other like it is and if we don't our clients will... you need to be someone who can deal with that while keeping up good morale and getting the job done. If you take things personally, or you're over politically correct, you need not apply.
Compensation & Incentives
This is a full-time remote work position, with a salary range of $36,000 to $41,000 per year plus health benefits and a variety of other perks. We're looking for a long term growth minded team member that wants to elevate their career in the marketing industry, and is willing to put in the work over the next 3 to 5 years.
If you think you'd be perfect for this role, apply now!
