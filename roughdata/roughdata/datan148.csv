At Horizons Digital Marketing, our vision is that we live in a world where every single person is empowered to follow their passion, build the life of their dreams and not be restricted by limiting beliefs. We help to empower small business owners and their teams by partnering with them to develop, create and optimize their digital marketing campaigns. This extends beyond our clients and to our team as well.
What We Do:
Our results-driven ad buying strategies are geared towards eCommerce businesses looking to scale their stores to 7 and 8 figures. Whether they just need an action plan, want to start slow or want us to take care of everything, we're here to help them with everything digital so that they can get back to focussing on running the business!
Our clients are leaders in their industry, long-term strategists and have built a strong reputation in the community they serve. Our job is to ensure that their brand image stays consistent online and offline and, more importantly, that their business is growing.
What Will YOU Do:
Digital Marketing Coordinators/Account Managers are the liaisons between the agency and its clients. They are the primary point of contact -- handling all day-to-day client interactions, as well as managing the projects and correcting issues as needed to ensure client success. They are committed to providing top-quality service and exceptional results above all else.
* IF you're serious about this opportunity, send us a quick video (more info at the bottom of this job description *
You will simultaneously be an agency representative, project manager, and most importantly, coach. We are NOT looking for “yes-people”, who do anything the client asks without critically examining whether it’s actually in their best interest.
We are looking for coaches -- marketing personal trainers. We need people who feel comfortable saying, “no we won’t do that, and here’s why…” to a misguided client request, and then coaching them towards the best course of action. Our Account Managers are able to call clients out when they fail to meet expectations or behave against their own self-interest, all while maintaining a positive relationship based on mutual respect and a shared goal of client success above all else.
What This Job Entails:
Managing a book of clients, serving as their primary point of contact via email, call text, and video call
This role will transform into client success team lead in 3-6 months for the right candidate
Manage a team of other digital marketing coordinators
Maintaining and developing client relationships based upon mutual respect, high-quality service, expectation setting, and coaching
Using the company core values to guide independent decisions about client accounts
Continually innovating new methods to improve client experience, results and retention
Managing the entire client life-cycle, including launch calls, check-ins, billing, and offboarding calls
Upselling clients on relevant products
Collecting client feedback and passing it along to the team to drive constant improvement
For your expertise, you will be rewarded with:
· Flexible working hours
· Remote working (now, of course, and after the pandemic)
· Room to grow into a management/leadership role (we're growing like crazy)
· Competitive compensation
Required Skills:
Most important is a positive attitude -- you see client dissatisfaction as an opportunity, not a burden
Exceptional interpersonal, verbal, and written communication skills in English. This is a must.
Driven, competitive, and confident with coaching others and setting expectations
Strong attention-to-detail, time-management, and organizational skills
At least a basic knowledge of digital advertising fundamentals, with a keen interest in learning more
Ability to multitask and prioritize under ever-changing needs and schedules
Proven project management skills with an emphasis on quality control
Self-starter -- you are comfortable working 100% remotely, managing projects and meeting deadlines without direct supervision
Coachable -- you are excited to participate in ongoing training and constantly push yourself to get better and better
Team player -- you are able to collaborate with a small team, ask for help when needed, and delegate tasks
Relational -- you get excited at the prospect of building long-term relationships with clients and coaching them towards success
Proactive -- you strive to get ahead of a problem, instead of waiting for it to become a full-blown fire
Required Experience:
2+ years of customer service/coaching experience
Direct Response Marketing experience (Facebook ads, Google Ads, Tiktok ads)
Previous experience with remote working softwares preferred, including Asana, Slack, Zoom, etc.
