Each week will bring a new challenge and our hope is to help you grow into the role!

You have produced visual content - weather that is video or infographic-based.

You have a desire to dive into articles, videos, and learning about the tech space including design, IoT, education, crypto/blockchain, community initiatives, best practices when developing/building a product, and more!
You have a willingness to help develop customer case studies, industry eBooks, and other content used to help the customer on their sales journey.
You have the ability to work in a team and distill information into themes/meaningful stories (this is also a learned skill).
You have experience working with a content calendar and hitting deadlines consistently.
You know how to build relationships across online communities and develop rapport with key stakeholders.
Hours & salary
The role is remote/blended for a total of 20 hours a week. Hours are flexible, however, we ask that a minimum of 2.5 hrs be allocated each day Monday to Thursday, between 10am-3pm (We want you to have enough time to do other things you care about). The position offers $20-$30 an hour based on experience.
