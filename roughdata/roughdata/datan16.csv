"MIDWIFE - Puvirnituq, QC - Indeed.com","The Inuulitsivik Health Centre, with more than 900 employees, is part of the Québec health and social services network in the Nunavik region. It provides front-line health and social services, notably for prevention, evaluation, diagnosis and treatment, rehabilitation and support, for the population of approximately 7 000 persons of the Hudson subregion. Moreover, it provides services related to youth protection as well as the management, on behalf of the Nunavik region, of Ullivik, located in Dorval. The Ullivik’s mission is to receive Inuit travelling South to receive health services from participating Montréal hospitals. The Inuit population is distributed among the seven communities along the Hudson Bay coast, from Kuujjuaraapik to Salluit.
Local and ‘southern’ trained midwives have been providing complete maternity, well-woman and well-baby care to the Inuit communities of the Hudson Bay Coast since 1986. Experienced local midwives and midwifery students provide services in Inuktitut. Midwifery education is based on a community-centered apprenticeship model, which strives to combine both traditional and modern ways of knowing and learning. In the fall of 2008, the Quebec Ministry of Health together with the Order of Quebec Midwives (OSFQ) granted recognition to Inuulitisivik’s Midwifery Education Program and its traditional learning pathways, offering full licensure to its graduates. Midwives from across Canada, the United States, Greenland, Scandinavia, France, England, Germany, and the Middle East have participated in the education program. The WHO, ICM, CAM, NAHO, and the SOGC have identified Inuulitsivik’s combined midwifery service and education program as an appropriate and realistic model for aboriginal and remote communities.
Each village maternity was initiated by and continues to take direction from the people of its community. Prior to the creation of these services, two generations of women were separated from their families and sent to Moose Factory (Ontario) to have their babies with people who did not share their language or cultural background. The effects of these evacuations were devastating not only for the families, but for the entire community. Now, most women on the Hudson Coast give birth to their babies in their own communities, their own culture and language, and with family and friends.
The Inuulitsivik Health Centre Maternity in Puvirnituq has been serving women and families for over 30 years. It is located in a wing of the Health Centre and serves its own village population and that of the smaller villages that do not yet have midwives. Puvirnituq midwives also receive and provide care during birth for women whose medical and social situations require additional or more specialized care than can easily be given in the more remote villages. The Inukjuak Maternity opened in 1996, and the Salluit maternity began training students in 2004. These maternities are located in the CLSC (nursing stations) and serve the women and families of their respective villages. Women who have a normal pregnancy and birth history have the opportunity to stay in their village to have their babies.
The reality of a remote northern region requires a larger scope of practice in both emergency care and community health than in southern midwifery practices. Midwives work in collaboration with medical and nursing staff and community service workers.
Working in the North is both challenging and rewarding. It is an opportunity to support the Inuit community in their efforts to regain autonomy for defining health and health care, and to reclaim birth as a normal and important community event.
Experience required
Must have authorization to work in Canada: citizenship or valid work permit;
Eligibility for registration with the OSFQ – reciprocity is available for midwives registered in other Canadian provinces. Unfortunately, new registrant’s from outside of Quebec cannot register with the OSFQ (reciprocity only applies to general registrants, without conditions);
Current Obstetric Emergency Skills certification;
Updated Neonatal Resuscitation certification (including intubation);
Autonomy and initiative;
At least 1 year of clinical midwifery practice is preferred;
Ability to speak and write French is an asset;
Northern and/or cross-cultural experience is also an asset.
An open mind, teaching skills and a capacity to listen;
Fluency in English (the second language of the local staff);
Conditions and benefits
Base salary between 31.29$ and 53.11$ / hour (based on experience);
Isolation and remote practice bonus;
Food allowance;
Paid over time;
Paid travel costs;
Furnished lodging provided by employer.
Additional details
Hired midwives will replace both local and southern midwifery staff that is on holiday or on leave. Together with local staff, you will participate in the functioning of the maternity and whenever possible, in the ongoing education of students.
