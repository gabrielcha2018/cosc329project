About Us
Initiative is different to other media agencies.
We are not trapped by a legacy structure primarily centered on paid advertising. Instead, we are liberated by a new world structure designed to deliver highly differentiated and highly effective communications strategies for our clients.
We’re not the biggest agency in town. So rather than outsize our competitors we must outsmart them. That’s why we’ve built the strongest strategic capability of any agency in the market. Core to this strategic capability is an obsession with culture and how brands can pivot from brand advertising (which is forgettable) to cultural branding (which is memorable).
Our new world model is comprised of four central “craft centers” – Client Advice and Management, Strategy, Communications Design and Partnerships.
OUR BEHAVIORS
Initiative respects that everyone has something unique to contribute to the agency.
We are a bunch of eclectic and brilliant misfits with diverse backgrounds that represent the unique fabric of consumers and culture.
We want you to be yourself. We want to hear your opinions. We want to see your passion and energy.
If you disagree with something you see or hear then speak up. We will never punish or penalize you for bringing something important to our attention.
If you believe you can improve something in the agency then speak up. We will always listen to your ideas and suggestions.
We will not tolerate harassment, bullying or corporate politics. We will not tolerate discrimination of any kind. We expect you to be responsible on social media and remember that you represent the agency and should not bring us into disrepute.
We are committed to your learning and development. The agency will organize regular training to enhance and accelerate your career – we expect you to prioritize training and actively participate.
We strive for world-class work on every client, every time.
We believe that good enough is not good enough."
