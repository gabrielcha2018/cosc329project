"Lifecycle Marketing Specialist - Montréal, QC - Indeed.com","What does your dream company look like? If it's a fun, hyper-growth startup where people look forward to coming to work Monday mornings, keep reading…
RenoRun was born in 2016 with the insight that contractors spend too much time away from their job sites by going to the store to procure materials. Before building out the concept, the co-founders—three construction industry veterans—would sit in different hardware store parking lots around Montreal in the winter, with Tim Horton's coffees, and notebooks in hand. They kept count of anyone coming out in work boots, plus vans and pickup trucks, and compared notes at the end of the day. This was their ""customer.""
After noticing that there were roughly 2,000 contractors per hour circulating hardware stores in Montreal, they decided to set out on a crusade to better serve them, and to unleash them from the unpleasantries that had been normalized in the construction industry.
Fast forward to today and we're one of the hottest tech start-ups, opening in cities all over Canada and the US, on our mission to '
empower contractors to build the world around us'
