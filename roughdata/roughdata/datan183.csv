Organizational Overview
In Canada, healthcare is universal. Access is not. Hope Air believes that where you live and how much money you have should not determine your access to medical care in Canada.
Hope Air is Canada’s only national charity providing free travel and accommodations for Canadians in financial need who must access medical care far from home. With 3.2 million Canadians living below the poverty line – including 566,000 children, 191,000 single mothers and 216,000 seniors - access to healthcare is not assured and cost is a huge barrier if you must travel to reach specialists far from home. The promise of Hope Air is that when it comes to healthcare, no one will be left behind no matter where they live or their financial challenges.
Hope Air’s travel and accommodation programs provide patients with an immediate and direct impact on their lives. As a result of Hope Air support, thousands of Canadians each year reach medical care rather than being forced to postpone or cancel medical treatments due to financial constraints. Hope Air’s programs help keep remote and smaller communities vibrant, enabling Canadians to continue to live where they choose regardless of local access to specialized medical care.
Hope Air has been chosen as one of Canada’s best 100 charities by Maclean’s magazine, MoneySense magazine and Charity Intelligence based on efficiency, transparency and need.
Hope Air is a well-performing national charity with a mission that has undeniable appeal. For the right leader, this is a unique and wonderful opportunity to have positive impact on the lives of Canadians who struggle to access the healthcare they need. Caring and patient-centric, the organization explores new and creative options to address those needs and sees significant opportunity to continue to grow."
