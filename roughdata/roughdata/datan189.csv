The dreamers who can see an opportunity and slowly and steadily get there, smartly.
Our marketing manager might come from an agency background or an interesting corporate background. They could come from a university, a start up, even strong background in a charity. They’re someone who can hustle, be scrappy and creative, and who has been through one hellish project that has gone terribly wrong and they’ve had to recover. Those are the great teachers!
Our marketing manager would ideally live in the Halifax area. They would have 7+ years experience with proven campaign marketing and digital ability. Knowledge of the insurance industry isn’t necessary, but a passion for learning is! They would have the option of setting up an office in our Lower Sackville office in addition to working from home. They would be largely autonomous in their workday. They would ideally be able to travel around Nova Scotia and PEI to connect with coworkers, insurance company representatives, and marketing agency partners.
