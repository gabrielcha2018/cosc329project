Who is Pod Marketing?
POD Marketing is a full-service digital marketing agency that offers clients a wide range of marketing solutions. Unlike other agencies, we specialize in 5 specific industries, which makes us true experts in both digital marketing
and
the industries we serve.
While we are committed to our clients, our number 1 priority has and always will be our employees. We believe this employee-obsessed approach is the biggest contributor to our company’s growth. In only 7+ years, we’re now working with over 200 clients across North America, which would not have been possible without employing a talented team of over 80 employees.
Office culture is not about having a beer fridge or a ping-pong table (but yes, we have those too), it’s about how being at work makes you feel. We asked our staff and here are some of the things they said they loved most about working at POD Marketing: They feel accepted for who they are, supported, challenged, enjoy the flexibility of being able to work from home, the open lines of communication with every member on the team including upper management, having physiological safety, and are energized by the opportunities to grow, develop and progress their careers.
