"Senior QA Engineer - Montréal, QC - Indeed.com","A quick snapshot…
We are looking for an individual who is passionate about quality assurance and automation. The senior quality assurance (QA) engineer will participate as part of a cross-functional Agile team and will advocate for and ensure quality for their team. You will participate in development design sessions and provide feedback from a quality perspective. You will coordinate best quality practices across other teams including offshore. You will lead and define transitions to embed quality practices within our new platform. And most importantly, you will be designing and developing automated testing for all layers of the solution (front and back end).
Why it's a big deal...
We are building a new team, platform and solutions and are looking to grow this area of expertise! This is an opportunity to come in and participate as we establish our standards and best practices.. This is a brand new platform and set of solutions, all developed in the latest technology stack -we're not just talking about putting automation in a legacy application. We're also working to establish modern DevOps practices - and this is a chance to be a key player in that process, as well.
Are you the person we're looking for?
Proven success with both automated and manual testing tools and technologies.
This is a must! Your test automation experiences include planning, assessments, script development and maintenance. You have hands-on experience with Cucumber and Selenium (or similar) automation frameworks and developing automation scripts. The technologies we are looking for include some of the following:
Gherkin
Cucumber
TestRail
CircleCI
BDD
TDD
TestNG
Restful APIs
Atlassian suite (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket)
SQL
Natural collaborator.
You work effectively with developers, BA's, Product Managers, and customers to draft test plans and test cases from an established set of requirements. You are proficient with Agile and a collaborative cross functional approach to building awesome software. You are comfortable working with offshore teams and collaborating on best practices across multiple Agile teams. You constantly seek opinions and solicit feedback in an effort to create the best work possible. You don't know any other way. It's a team effort - and you completely appreciate that.
Confident and deliberate communicator.
You have a point of view and you're completely comfortable defending it to any person or group, regardless of level or status. It's a confidence that comes from experience. And that's not to say you aren't open to different views; but, when you feel strongly about a particular matter, you don't give up easily. You're at ease with lively debate - in fact, you welcome it. Your points are clear and concise. And you're equally as respected for your knowledge and expertise as for your style and approach.
Quality orientation.
You rarely make mistakes because you have good processes in place to ensure that every last detail is correct. But in those rare occasions when errors are realized (let's face it, it happens to the best of us from time to time), you own them, correct them, learn from them, and then quickly adjust and communicate processes to ensure the same mistake doesn't happen twice. It's your transparency, authenticity and humility is what sets you apart from the rest.
Stays cool when things get crazy.
We're growing fast - which translates to an ever-changing, super fast-paced work environment. This may involve immediate changes to plans and timelines. Your ability to quickly analyze situations and effectively prioritize tasks is what sets you apart from the rest. Rest assured: you've got this.
