265,"Full Stack Developer - Toronto, ON - Indeed.com","About Us
Rivvi is changing the way the world gets paid. We call it Payroll 2.0.
It used to be that the payroll department needed time to make sure everybody’s pay was accurate, then to send money to their payroll provider who could then do all the payroll calculations and deposit your pay to your bank account. But as consumer behaviour has shifted with the growth of everything being available on demand, payroll has failed to adapt with our expectations. More and more, people have bills that are due on a regular basis and with the impact of COVID-19, need to pay in advance for items they are ordering online.
Meanwhile, businesses are spending billions of dollars a year on administering payroll, from checking timesheets, calculating hours, entering duplicate data between multiple software programs and double checking everything to ensure there are no mistakes. Even after spending all this time and money to get it right, businesses pay billions more in penalties for errors and omissions caused in their ‘meticulous’ payroll processes.
Rivvi is rethinking payroll with our perspective on a payroll platform that automates the entire payroll process and ensures 100% compliance. In addition, we enable employees to choose their own payday, allowing them to align their pay with their own personal circumstances and not being forced to access short term payday loan services. Our mission is to help workers ultimately live better lives.
This position is subject to our Working Remotely Corporate Policy and Procedure, which provides workplace flexibility and reduces the requirement for the successful applicant to work, in-person.

As this is an early stage startup, you are encouraged to think holistically about problems and how solutions impact the customer.
To be successful as a full stack developer, you should have a sound knowledge of software engineering as well as excellent analytical skills. A good developer studies the consumer market and client needs to develop cutting-edge applications.
If you’re passionate about development and translating code into user-friendly apps, we would like to meet you. As a full stack developer, you’ll collaborate with internal team members to develop a functional application, while working in a fast-paced environment.

Taiv (YC W20) uses ML to make TV commercials as targeted and accessible as Facebook ads. We’re democratizing TV by letting anyone advertise for as little as $300.
Why It Matters?
We think that all ad channels should be accessible to everyone. Right now, only big companies can buy TV spots, plus they are poorly targeted and hard to track. We want to change that and transform a $150bn market in the process. We also share the revenue with the people who own the TVs, which we think is the way that advertising should work.
Cool, But How Does It Work?
We partner with bars and install custom hardware, which attaches to their cable box and uses computer vision to detect commercials in real-time (more about that below). When it cuts to commercial break, we dynamically insert ads that are perfect for that environment. We sell the ads at a premium and then give the bars 30%.

Alright, take two on this job posting! We headed back to the drawing board to brainstorm how we can find an authentic, hard-working individual and we have decided to up the stakes. This position (and the rest of the company) received a pay bump in order to maintain market competitiveness in this rapidly evolving industry that we all know and love. We really value our employees and like to show our appreciation through transparency and authenticity to our core. Great to see you’ve made it this far, now if you want to know more about what your day would look like at TerraSense, keep reading!
*
WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.
*
WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...*
...on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. As a Senior developer, you will bring your experience and expertise to support one or more of our scrums to build and refine our sensor integrations, real-time data processing, data fusion algorithms, and/or software integrations. You will use your Python / C(++) skills to develop, maintain, optimize, and document MIST code while mentoring your peers and supporting junior developers. You will contribute to our ongoing efforts to build high-functioning DevSecOps and MLOps pipelines, building and enhancing the tools and systems we use to make deployable AI software.
Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a
Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check
.
You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours.
These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.
*
QUALIFICATIONS*
A leading expert in your field with a track record to back it up
Comfortable leading and mentoring a team
Minimum 3 years of industry experience with software development
Solid knowledge of Python and C/C++ development
Experience developing & maintaining deployable code
Familiarity with version control (Git), Agile, and DevSecOps development
A passion for coding and an interest in machine learning
Experience working with small teams
For soft skills we would like you the most if you were adaptable, creative, multidisciplinary, self-directed
Eligible for security clearance and to work in Canada
Bonus: Experience working with video feeds and sensor data
Bonus: Experience with technical writing

$115,000-$125,000

698,Software Engineer - British Columbia - Indeed.com,"Looking for a new engineering position but dreading leetcode-style questions? Having flashbacks thinking about re-reading
Cracking the Coding Interview
? Apply to Fraction! Our engineering interview process has been described as ""surprisingly humane"". There's no leetcode questions, no all-day onsite interview gauntlet.
Here's the full process, broken down:
Initial call
to make sure you think the position/company is a fit for you. Fraction is a Series A startup, so you have to want to work at a small, rapidly growing company. There might be a small systems-design technical question, but there's no need to prepare for it.
Take-home challenge
. Takes time, we know, but our hope is that it a) it more closely shows how you actually produce work, and b) it is our replacement for the painful all-day onsite that lots of companies do. Takes anywhere from 3-8 hours depending on your speed, so we give people a week to do it. Somewhat unique (as far as we know) is that we actually have every single person in the company across all departments do a take-home challenge. We give you the option to do a backend challenge or a frontend challenge - your preference. Frontend is written in React, backend we've provided a template with NodeJS but you can use any number of language - again, your preference. We used to have a full-stack challenge, but honestly it just took too long for people to complete, so we retired it.
A quick
call to go over your take-home
, this is your opportunity to brag about the things you built in the challenge. If there are any issues in the challenge that we noticed, we will try to suss out if you are able to figure out what those issues are.
A final
culture/values interview with the co-founders
. This is a chance for you to get some face-time with each of the founders to get a feel for the vision we are trying to enact and to make sure it resonates with you.
What's the work like?
Fraction is building a number of new and exciting technically-challenging projects that you will be one of the first people to work on. Since the company is so young (launched in February 2021!), there's lots of completely new projects, only some maintaining of existing projects, and absolutely no legacy code. Upcoming projects that you might be the one kickstarting include:
An event system for managing asynchronous workflows.
A payments system to enable Fraction's customers to make and receive payments.
A dashboard for customers to interact with our platform, and another dashboard for our internal operations team to automate their workflows.
Remote vs. Onsite?
We want to let people work however they want. You want to work in the office every day, go for it! We have offices in Vancouver and Berkeley. You live somewhere else but want an office? Who knows, we could be convinced to open an office for you. You want to work fully remote? Your choice! You can work anywhere in the US or Canada. If you want to travel while working, go for it, as long as you still somewhat overlap with our timezone.
Many of our team members do a hybrid of some days in the office and some days remote, but about half of our team is totally remote - so it's up to you!
What are the expectations?
A year of experience. If you are a new grad, your internships/co-ops count toward this!
Frontend or backend: we are hiring for all types of engineers. Although our stack is all Typescript, if you are backend-focused, we don't require experience with it (if you are frontend, we do expect you'll have experience with React, as it is part of our take-home challenge and you'd be unlikely to complete it successfully without that experience).
You own your work. We are a young startup, so each and every person has a massive impact on the success of the company. With great power comes great responsibility.
What about compensation?
Since we are a startup, we often get the question of whether our compensation will be competitive. The answer is yes! We are very well capitalized, and are willing to invest lots in great talent.
Since we are a startup and we also provide equity, your total compensation is tied to the long-term success of the company, so we want you to believe in the company! That's part of that initial call in the process, where you have the opportunity to ask as many questions as you want about our business model, how we make money, our vision for the future, our runway, etc.
What does Fraction do?
Fraction is a Series A fintech company. We've come out with the first truly innovative mortgage/HELOC product in the last couple decades. This isn't just a spin on a better application process, it's genuinely a new product in a new category to enable people to access the equity in their homes. Along with the new product, we are building our systems from the ground up to enable a better, faster, and more transparent user experience."

Metrics Watch cherche sa première ou son premier dev à temps plein! (
à part moi
)
Metrics Watch?
Metrics Watch est une plateforme en ligne (SaaS) de rapport marketing. Elle se démarque de ses compétiteurs en étant
email-based
. Il y a aussi une fonctionnalité d'alertes Google Analytics en temps réel.
Des compagnies de partout dans le monde utilisent Metrics Watch: petites et grandes, dont Greyhound, Lindt, onvista et plusieurs autres.
En tant que première personne à temps plein au dev...
...tu vas avoir un impact majeur sur les projets et fonctionnalités. Tu auras beaucoup d’autonomie et d’impact sur les choix et l’architecture.
On travaillera ensemble pour faire de Metrics Watch une plateforme encore meilleure pour nos clients en ajoutant de nouvelles fonctionnalités, en bonifiant celles en places et avec des projets de R&D pour développer Metrics Watch à un autre niveau.
Tu auras une très grande liberté, sans être laissé à toi-même.
Mais encore?
Bonne question! Quoiqu’un peu floue.
Je vais assumer que tu veux entendre parler du
stack
techno un peu. Je me trompe?
Metrics Watch est une application web principalement bâtie en Ruby on Rails avec React pour certaines portions. Nous avons aussi d’autres applications en Node et Golang, mais le gros du travail se fait sur l’application Ruby on Rails. Le tout avec PostgreSQL et hébergé sur Heroku.
On a une bonne couverture de tests automatisés qui donne beaucoup de confiance lorsque vient le temps d'intégrer de nouveaux changements et le tout est déployé automatiquement en production par CI&CD.
“
Cool -- et je vais faire quoi au jour le jour?
”
Ça passera entre autres par (ça, c’est la section “tâches”):
Ajouter des nouvelles fonctionnalités (intégrations Google Sheets, templates et widgets préétablis, rendre la création de rapports plus flexible, découper le rendu des rapports actuel afin de rendre le tout disponible via un API et une couche de rendu, ce qui permettra la génération de rapport par courriel, le web et potentiellement d’autres plateformes de distribution, etc)
Régler des bugs (
hé oui, on ne fait pas exception, on a parfois des bugs!
)
Mettre à jour nos outils
Participer à la vision et la définition du produit
Ok, je suis partant.e. Y’a autre chose à savoir?
La section “exigences” ressemblerait à ceci:
Tu es intéressé.e par le monde des startups web et du SaaS.
Expérience en dev full stack, mais PAS nécessairement d’expérience avec notre

Bon niveau d'anglais
Tu es à l’aise dans un contexte de communication à distance et asynchrone.
Tu es friand.e d’autoapprentissage, i.e. tu n’as pas peur d’utiliser Google (ou DuckDuckGo, etc.).
Si tu as encore des questions, tu peux me contacter par courriel sans problème!

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and shuttles. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and San Diego County.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.
RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. At RideCo, we celebrate diversity, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our customers, our products, and our community. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Please let us know if you require accommodation during the recruitment process."
