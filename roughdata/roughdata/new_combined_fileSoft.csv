Alright, take two on this job posting! We headed back to the drawing board to brainstorm how we can find an authentic, hard-working individual and we have decided to up the stakes. This position (and the rest of the company) received a pay bump in order to maintain market competitiveness in this rapidly evolving industry that we all know and love. We really value our employees and like to show our appreciation through transparency and authenticity to our core. Great to see you’ve made it this far, now if you want to know more about what your day would look like at TerraSense, keep reading!
*
WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our main product targets the Aerospace and Defence sectors, using deep learning to surveil targets using cutting-edge airborne optical and radar sensors. Besides understanding how to use AI to monitor airborne sensors, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.
Hint: A lot of our hires for this role have gotten noticed by writing an awesome cover letter that really leaned on our company pillar of “Authenticity” (tell us who you are, without all the corporate jargon).
*
WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...*
...on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. As a Junior developer, you will be a generalist, learning the various components of our tech stack and applying your skills with Python / C(++) and Git to develop, maintain, optimize, and document the MIST software system. You will work regularly with Docker, Git, video and sensor data processing libraries, and support the deployment of machine learning models using a range of GPU and CUDA powered tools, with plenty of opportunity to learn on the job from peers, mentors, and courses.
Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a
Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check
.
You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours.
These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.
*
QUALIFICATIONS*
Solid knowledge of Python and/or C/C++ development (passion and academic projects count!)
Familiarity with version control (Git) and Agile development
Experience developing & maintaining deployable code
A passion for coding and an interest in machine learning (You will be working closely with our machine learning developers)
Experience working with small teams
For soft skills we would like you the most if you were adaptable, creative, multidisciplinary, self-directed
Eligible for security clearance and to work in Canada
Bonus: Experience with technical writing
COMPENSATION
$85,000-$95,000
10% salary enhancement for all candidates required to pass security requirements (local, flexible to come to the office as required, willing to be vetted)
Stock options based on experience, competency and length of service
5 weeks paid vacation
Relocation expenses paid for
Medical, dental and vision after 3 months of employment
Training and professional development allowance, and extended medical and dental
Beer Tuesdays at our neighbourhood microbrewery (post Covid!)
*
NON - COMPENSATION CONSIDERATIONS*
Accountability: We truly do work hard, play hard and expect everyone to self manage...meaning we don’t track hours.
Flexibility: If your best time to work is from 10pm to 2am, or you have kid drop offs and pickups, then we want to support that! We try to enable team communication by committing to M-Th 10am-2pm “office hours.” The rest is up to you.

Do you love tinkering with super geeky things?
Are you technically creative and a natural problem solver?
Do you love learning new technologies and stepping outside your comfort zone?
Do you get sh*t done and can you be counted on while working independently?
Then come work for us! We are looking for a Junior Web Developer to join our expanding and dynamic team.
You will work closely with our CTO on various projects, ranging from prototyping, developing and testing new product & service ideas to updates and changes to our existing WordPress website.
About us
Outshinery helps businesses of all sizes that sell wine, beer and spirits with high-quality, ready-to-use product photography and videos, without the need for physical samples. We have over 600 customers on all continents and are only getting started!
Why we think we can be pretty awesome for the right person!
We entrust and invest in our team of go-getters, doers, and (random fact) side-hustle bakers.
We love to learn and look at the glass half-full in any difficult situation.
We commit to bringing delight in every way possible, whenever possible.
We leverage technology to get all of the “boring” work done, so that instead we can do work that is creative, challenging, and truly interesting.
We donate 5% of our profits to WaterAid Canada (because wine or beer is only so good when enjoyed next to a glass of clean water).
Your role
We are a small, fully-remote, and fast-growing startup. You’ll likely be involved in many exciting projects across different departments. That said, here are the main responsibilities you will tackle:
Brainstorm and explore product & service ideas with the team
Develop rough prototypes and MVPs of said ideas
Make tech stack recommendations and research different approaches to building various tools and projects
Make occasional changes to our WordPress website
Requirements
Basic knowledge of PHP/SQL, Javascript, JQuery, HTML5
Experience with WordPress and various plugins
Use of Stackoverflow and Google to help answer your own questions
Ability to think outside the box
Enjoy solving problems, neatly organized things and setting your own course
Reliable and enthusiastic (always looking at the glass half-full!)
Love helping people and love to write
Familiarity with various business and organizational software (e.g. Asana, Airtable, Drift, ActiveCampaign, Zapier, etc.) or be super eager to learn!
Interest in “anything alcohol” is also a nice touch!
Notes
This is remote work. Must be located in Canada and ideally in British Columbia.
This job requires drive and self-direction, but you’ll be part of a supportive team spread across the world that is all in there for the win!
Apply by email:
luke@outshinery.com (We’ll be contacting selected candidates for a video interview.)
We’d love to see your resume, but skip the cover letter!Instead, please provide links to projects, GITs, code examples or anything else you’re proud of that you think we’d love to check out. We look forward to hearing from you!"

Role Description
We are looking for a software engineer to join us and help build the future of our web apps. You'll have the opportunity to work on diverse and interesting challenges as we scale up and help shape both our product and how we work.
When you are not busy writing code, you will be contributing to code reviews, supporting other developers, and working with the team to improve how we work.
The Opportunity
You’ll have visibility into, and influence over, all parts of the technology stack, and enjoy a high degree of autonomy in your work.
You’ll have a clear view of the product roadmap, the business’ long-term vision, and the opportunity to constructively contribute to both.
You’ll interact with users, and be able to influence what solutions are chosen to meet their needs.
You’ll contribute to the planning, design, development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of significant portions of the software that supports the chosen solutions.
You’ll have the chance to provide and receive feedback from your peers, and get coaching from more experienced engineers both within the team and the broader organization.
You’ll use modern tooling throughout, whether that’s something currently part of our stack, or something new that you assess needs to be added to reliably deliver the desired user experience. A snapshot of what’s currently in-use:
client: ReactJS, jQuery/Javascript, Webpack
server: Rails, Sidekiq, Redis
DB: MySQL
Infrastructure: AWS (various services), built with Terraform.

The Expectations
You’ll be responsible for contributing to the design and delivery of a significant portion of the software that supports the business, and for monitoring and maintaining that software in production.
You’ll be responsible for finding opportunities to iteratively improve our technology in any feature you work on, paying down technical debt as a habit
You’ll put in the work necessary to empathize with the software’s users, and understand their challenges on an emotional level, whether those users are fellow developers, immediate team members, representatives of partner organizations, or end users.
You’ll embrace an owner’s mindset: continually striving to make an impact; investing time, energy, and capital as if they were your own; and understanding that no part of the business is outside the scope of your position.
You have some production Rails experience, and are starting to form clear opinions about how different development patterns and practices can both negatively and positively impact your ability to be productive in a codebase, and by extension, the reliability of a business’ software platform.
You’re curious, and naturally invest energy into learning new technologies, techniques, and interpersonal skills that, you feel, help improve your own productivity and happiness, and the productivity and happiness of those around you. You’re starting to really enjoy what you do, and you’re eager to learn how to do it better.
You aspire to have excellent spoken and written communication, time management, and project management abilities. You behave proactively to set expectations and find support when you recognize that there are unforeseen challenges or complexity in projects. It doesn’t take too much work for your team members to clearly understand the state of your work, your delivery plans, and your ideas for improving the business’ software, technology processes, and team culture.

Who we are:
http://www.rideco.com
RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses and shuttles. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, Calgary Transit, and San Diego County.
Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van /sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.
RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.
RideCo is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. At RideCo, we celebrate diversity, and we thrive on it for the benefit of our employees, our customers, our products, and our community. We believe the more inclusive we are, the better our work will be. Please let us know if you require accommodation during the recruitment process."

here are brief descriptions of each
team
that is hiring.
POS Modernization:
POS Modernization’s goal is the modernization of iQmetrix sales flows to provide a consistent experience across all of our products. To achieve this, we are writing a suite of flexible microservices that are developed with particular attention to how a POS system should work, which is not necessarily how our systems currently work. The methods we are using will also enable a strong API experience for clients. We are a full stack team that, due to our microservice focus, writes primarily C# with some custom libraries and SQL. However, we also maintain some legacy code and occasionally need to do some WPF UI work. In most of our work, we rely heavily on principles of functional programming, unit testing, and integration testing to create performant, bug free software.
RQ Consumer Experience:
The RQ Consumer Experience team owns sales and customers related flows in our core product RQ. Our job is to keep adding values to it by implementing new functionalities, refactoring existing legacy code and increasing test coverage. We also own a couple of microservices to fulfill some particular needs of our clients. With all of these, we are trying to create great experience for our customers.
We are looking for a senior developer with strong C# skills and web service development, who is an expert on delivering high quality solutions, also a mentor who is willing to share knowledge and help others in the team to grow.”

We are looking for an intermediate or senior full stack developer, with strong C# skills and web service development, to add new ideas and perspectives that will help the team grow and develop reliable, secure, high quality solutions for our clients and other development teams.
Purpose of Each Role:
We are looking for multiple developers with strong C# development and communication skills. Successful candidates will take ownership of solving tough problems, communicating solutions with internal clients (sometimes external), and are a master of balancing quality and speed. They will take initiative to learn and understand technical solutions, work collaboratively with other developers and internal/external stakeholders, and meet challenges as they arise.
Accountabilities:
You will be part of a skilled team of developers which solves complex problems for our biggest multi-million-dollar accounts while creating an excellent client experience.
You will be playing a fundamental role in designing and implementing our ambitious integrations and product features.
You will have the opportunity to grow your skills by working as a part of the team while striving to find the best solutions.
You will be creating and contributing to large-scale architectural plans and solutions that create unique and cutting-edge retail experiences for some of the largest retailers in the world.
You will be brainstorming and working with clients to understand the clients’ needs
Qualifications:
Comfortable with developing on a C# web stack (e.g. ASP.NET Core)
Strong foundation in object-oriented design
Experience in all phases of the software development lifecycle
Recommended (more is better):
Experience developing software which uses cloud technologies (eg. message queues, NoSQL data storage, serverless applications).
Previous full-stack development experience (Front and Back End).

During this time of remote learning environment, the PTACs do not have access to Official Files. If there are documents you submitted to your Official File you would like the PTAC to use in the review of your application, you will need to include those documents when applying for positions.
All job postings will be for in-person teaching, unless they are indicated ""OC"" for Online Course or ""Remote"" for remote teaching. OC and Remote teaching is defined below.
Courses created specifically for online instruction have been collaboratively designed by a content expert (normally a faculty member) and an instructional designer and digital media and educational technology specialists. Online course development is guided by instructional design strategies and makes use of pedagogically led technology. Online courses are intentionally developed for instructors and students to be separated by space (location) and/or time (often both).
Remote instruction, as the term is used here, uses technology-enabled tools and software to facilitate course delivery when in-person instruction is not possible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Remote"" instruction is not directly comparable to ""online course"" instruction. The difference is not in the quality of the content, but in the design of content delivery.

Sonar is an enterprise, B2B SaaS product, targeted towards ISPs. It provides numerous features for ISPs such as billing, ticketing, network monitoring, inventory management, scheduling, service provisioning, and more.
We are looking to add at least one more backend dev to the team, and here's what's cool about the job:
1. Fully remote - we don't have an office anywhere!
2. Flexible working hours
3. Interesting tech - we have a GraphQL API, full CI/CD setup, Kubernetes deployment in Azure, plenty of interesting stuff on the backend (Postgres, ElasticSearch, Redis, Swoole, etc.)
4. Constant challenges - we've already done all the boring stuff, so it's mostly building interesting new features, or working on new integrations - for example, we're currently integrating Looker, working on a Twilio integration, building a mobile app, and lots more..
5. Great team/culture - 40 hour weeks are what we do, we aggressively hire (and fire) to maintain a good, healthy culture, and we really care about our employees. Full benefits are provided, along with a stipend for home office equipment that you can spend on almost anything you want. We have a book-sharing club, we pay for conferences, and it's just generally a chill, fun place to work.
6. We are engaged in all kinds of great outside projects - for example, we're a partner in Microsoft Airband, which is bringing Internet access to millions of unserved people around the world.
Here's what we need:
1. A great backend developer. Sonar is built using PHP+Laravel, running on Swoole. Someone with a deep level of experience in PHP would be great but, to be honest, I'm happy to hire anyone that is extremely competent in backend development and doesn't have an issue writing PHP : )
2. Someone who is extremely self-motivated. We tend to err on the side of leaving people alone to get work done, and since we're fully remote, that means you need to be really motivated and capable of working by yourself. For some people, this is pretty tough. If it sounds like a dream to you, you're good.
3. Someone who has a high level of experience and a good breadth of knowledge. We are always building challenging stuff, and we have significant complexity in the platform. We have to think about things like PCI compliance, security, SLA maintenance, and more - and it's a constant battle. Someone in this role needs to be able to think about the big picture and understand how things interconnect. You should have the kind of mind that is always thinking about security and performance when writing code.
You should have a clear idea of what makes a good backend developer - you should enjoy writing tests, you should enjoy researching the best solution to a problem, and you should have a good understanding of the current technology landscape. There isn't really any DevOps in this position, but you should understand things like Kubernetes/containerization, when relational databases beat NoSQL, or why someone would use ElasticSearch, Hadoop, or Snowflake, for example.
Pay for this position is commensurate with experience.
Here are the hard requirements - We just delete applications that ignore these : )
1. No agencies/contract work/etc. I'm looking for individual, full-time employees.
2. Only hiring in Canada - no exceptions.
3. Please make it clear in your resume how you meet the technical requirements listed - I always get a ton of applications, and lots of them are people that really aren't qualified. Help me help you - call out that you've read what I'm looking for, and speak to how you are a good fit."

268,"Full Stack Developer - Toronto, ON - Indeed.com","About Us
Rivvi is changing the way the world gets paid. We call it Payroll 2.0.
It used to be that the payroll department needed time to make sure everybody’s pay was accurate, then to send money to their payroll provider who could then do all the payroll calculations and deposit your pay to your bank account. But as consumer behaviour has shifted with the growth of everything being available on demand, payroll has failed to adapt with our expectations. More and more, people have bills that are due on a regular basis and with the impact of COVID-19, need to pay in advance for items they are ordering online.
Meanwhile, businesses are spending billions of dollars a year on administering payroll, from checking timesheets, calculating hours, entering duplicate data between multiple software programs and double checking everything to ensure there are no mistakes. Even after spending all this time and money to get it right, businesses pay billions more in penalties for errors and omissions caused in their ‘meticulous’ payroll processes.
Rivvi is rethinking payroll with our perspective on a payroll platform that automates the entire payroll process and ensures 100% compliance. In addition, we enable employees to choose their own payday, allowing them to align their pay with their own personal circumstances and not being forced to access short term payday loan services. Our mission is to help workers ultimately live better lives.
This position is subject to our Working Remotely Corporate Policy and Procedure, which provides workplace flexibility and reduces the requirement for the successful applicant to work, in-person.

We are looking for a full stack developer to join our engineering team. You’ll work with a seasoned team of entrepreneurs, designers, developers and managers to understand the problem and shape a product that exceeds its users’ needs.
You’ll bring designs to life in scalable, responsive web applications. You’ll also help design, build, debug and maintain an API platform,across services and multiple levels of the stack. As this is an early stage startup, you are encouraged to think holistically about problems and how solutions impact the customer.
To be successful as a full stack developer, you should have a sound knowledge of software engineering as well as excellent analytical skills. A good developer studies the consumer market and client needs to develop cutting-edge applications.
If you’re passionate about development and translating code into user-friendly apps, we would like to meet you. As a full stack developer, you’ll collaborate with internal team members to develop a functional application, while working in a fast-paced environment.
Since we are a small team, you will also play a big role in the design and planning of the functionality as well as the look and feel. We like to work on weekly sprints and you’ll definitely have enough focus in a given week to accomplish big things, but you can expect a good amount of diversity and learning new skills.
Above all, we want you to take risks! This role is a hybrid of front end and back end with a wide scope of impact. Have fun. Try new things. Stand out!

Courses created specifically for online instruction have been collaboratively designed by a content expert (normally a faculty member) and an instructional designer and digital media and educational technology specialists. Online course development is guided by instructional design strategies and makes use of pedagogically led technology. Online courses are intentionally developed for instructors and students to be separated by space (location) and/or time (often both).
Remote instruction, as the term is used here, uses technology-enabled tools and software to facilitate course delivery when in-person instruction is not possible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

All job postings will be for in-person teaching, unless they are indicated ""OC"" for Online Course or ""Remote"" for remote teaching. OC and Remote teaching is defined below.
Courses created specifically for online instruction have been collaboratively designed by a content expert (normally a faculty member) and an instructional designer and digital media and educational technology specialists. Online course development is guided by instructional design strategies and makes use of pedagogically led technology. Online courses are intentionally developed for instructors and students to be separated by space (location) and/or time (often both).
Remote instruction, as the term is used here, uses technology-enabled tools and software to facilitate course delivery when in-person instruction is not possible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Remote"" instruction is not directly comparable to ""online course"" instruction. The difference is not in the quality of the content, but in the design of content delivery.

About the Company
Riskfuel is pioneering the use of deep neural networks to accelerate the proprietary financial models used to calculate the values and the risk sensitivities of the financial instruments held by capital markets and insurance firms. Given the size of these portfolios and the many different risk sensitivities required, these models are run in large, overnight batch processes spread over thousands of servers. Riskfuel dramatically accelerates the process by constructing functionally equivalent models using DNNs. The Riskfuel models are a million times faster so that what once took all night to run can now be completed in seconds. With Riskfuel models, you get real-time valuation and risk management … and a massive reduction in the compute workload, saving money and reducing the firm’s environmental footprint.
We are doing exciting cutting-edge research and our technology is winning major industry awards.

Here are some of the things you would be working on:
Designing and training deep neural nets
Understanding client’s models used in valuation of traded derivatives products and insurance contracts
Creating dataset generation strategies, considering the statistical distribution of input values and the downstream effects on ML training results

Here’s
what we do and why we do it.
Simply put, we will work together to simplify businesses’ IT with cloud technology so they can focus on what really matters, making people’s lives better. Discover how we do that here: www.sherweb.com/about/
How do we do it?
Our team structure embraces agile and DevOps values, by product, with a strong bond that unites us to share and unify our practices. To achieve this, we have even created our own
DevEx
team which has only one mission:
Help development teams to be even more efficient in order to deliver value in a sustainable way!
We take pride in what we deliver as a product and our customers make us feel it! It’s because of the teamwork, passion and customer focus (basically Sherweb values!) that we get there!
Our management team, aware of the 2021 reality, supports us in our organization, listens to us and offers us modern and innovative evolution. Last one on the list: self-assignment of team members once a year!
Are you starting to feel the vibe? ;) Basically, we always try to improve, modernize, even if everything is not always perfect
Here's what we are looking for:
Good developers, team players, always eager to learn and improve their skills, who like well-structured and high-performance code, object oriented, and that excel in backend or frontend or both.
So if you want to work hard in a multidisciplinary product team, really be the “owner” of what you do, have fun with your colleagues (happy hours, online gaming nights, Friday beer), all in a flexible and respectful environment, well Sherweb is the place where you want to work, and for a long time!
Here's what we offer:
Flexible schedule (35 to 40 hours per week)
Flexible group insurance according to your needs, including a healthcare spending account and telemedicine
Advantageous savings plan (RRSP or TFSA) with Sherweb’s contribution
Annual vacations available from your first day
Paid training hours
Post-Covid remote work possible.
Here's the ideal background for this position:
Demonstrated experience (minimum 5 years) in developing Web applications, APIs and SaaS products
Knowledge and application of SOLID and DDD principles, as well as a strong orientation for clean code
Experience with the following technologies: .Net Core, .Net Framework, C#, Angular, EntityFramework, Nhibernate (or other frameworks), SQL Server, MongoDB, RabbitMQ
If your experience is in Java and you are interested in learning C#, we have an internal training team to support you
Bilingualism (French and English)
College or University diploma in computer science.
If you have these skills, you will fit right in with us:
Communication skills
– Why? Because you will be expected to explain and vulgarize concepts by adapting the style and content of your messages to your audience (whether it’s internal client, external clients or your teammates).
Organization and resourcefulness
– Why? Because we don’t believe in micromanagement. You will need to figure out solutions on your own by using your skills, your knowledge and any relevant information you can get your hands on.
Problem-solving skills
– Why? Because when you will face a problem, you will first analyze the information before identifying the possible causes. You will then explore and implement the most efficient and logical solutions.
Adaptability
– Why? Because our industry evolves constantly. You will have to adjust your thinking and methods to better suit new or unplanned situations (whether it’s for your daily tasks or your work environment).
Here’s
what you can expect from us.
Shortcutting your journey to your aspirations is possible when you surround yourself early on with knowledgeable and genuine people. We will put you in charge of important responsibilities from the beginning so that you can build your professional reputation. We will also help you quickly identify your strengths to build a strong foundation for your potential.
This is our team philosophy.
Humans were built to create. What unites our team is the sense of purpose we get from building the platforms that make technology possible and accessible for people. That's who we are, not just what we do. If you share this philosophy, you might just be one of us. Send us your resume to tell us your story.
Sherweb is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving an environment of diversity and inclusion where everybody can feel welcome. We're looking to grow our teams with people who share our passion for innovation and creating the best experience for our employees, partners and clients.

About IronSight
IronSight is the vac truck-turned-software company. We initially built IronSight as an internal tool to dispatch our field team more efficiently and allow our oil and gas clients to send us job requests and track our trucks. In the early days, they jokingly referred to us as the Uber-of-the-oilfield. We eventually decided to sell our trucks and market the software to large energy producers struggling with the same problems we had. Over the years, IronSight has evolved into a platform for intelligent field operations that helps large industrial operations and service providers work more efficiently together.
Our apps take a job through its entire life cycle: from request, to scheduling, to execution, to field ticketing, and finally to analytics. Coordinators have a birds-eye view of workers, tasks, and assets in the field. Several of the world’s largest energy producers are currently using IronSight in partnership with their service providers. Our long-term goal is to transition IronSight into a marketplace that enables cross-organization collaboration. In simple terms, we want energy producers to discover and send jobs to service providers, then track them as they execute the work. We want both parties on this two-sided platform to become more efficient through improved communication, elimination of manual processes, and application of business intelligence and AI/ML to the data collected from the field.

Rewind is a service that protects the data that is driving your business, from a simple side hustle to a successful venture. Our focus is on backing up data that lives in the cloud – in apps like Shopify, BigCommerce, and QuickBooks Online. We invite you to read our startup story to learn where we came from and where we’re going. For a more technical view, check out our Behind the App feature on the BigCommerce Developers Blog.
We care about honesty, we believe in learning from our mistakes, and we support each other as we grow.
*
ABOUT THE JOB*
The development team at Rewind is made up of four small teams of 5 people; these people work together, collaboratively, to build new features and functions for our amazing customers.
In broad terms, each member of the team is responsible for the following:
Collaborating with other members of the development team to derive the best possible design to meet requirements
Implementing, testing, documenting, and maintaining back-end systems for multiple high-traffic services
Providing constructive feedback in the form of code and design reviews
Looking for ways to improve our development and deployment processes
Ensuring security and performance of our products
Day to day, you will work alongside other members of the team to bring new features to our growing list of services. Rewind is a large system made up of several components that all interwork in harmony. Some ideas we have in the backlog that have not made their way into our services include user management, action auditing, anomaly detection, dynamic reporting, exporting, trend analysis, real-time data translation, copy…
Developing reliable, securable, scalable, supportable code is a must. You will help put out some fires, especially the ones you accidentally created (we value accountability), including incident response and remediation, but your main focus will be the reliability and robustness in all the things you help build. Less-flammable apps; fewer smouldering embers; automated fire suppression.
You need an observant eye for details, whether it’s with code, spelling, or something else entirely. Prove it to us –
address your ""Why do you want to work with us"" question to Ms. Rails
.
This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.
Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:
Adoption of Shopify’s new versioned API - this one keeps us in business!
Support for Shopify’s new bulk APIs; this cut our operating costs (fewer servers) and increased the speed of our backups.
Rewind Copy for QuickBooks; #1 feature request for QuickBooks customers, move your data from here to there and make it easy.
Rewind API (version 1); services that want to power data resiliency in their apps with Rewind can now do so.
Hooking Hubspot into various areas of our product to capture customer events for sales/marketing.
Addressing multiple code and database scaling challenges in the processing of daily backups for our American BigCommerce customers.
Adding support for new entry level pricing plans that required creating limitations in product functionality.
Implementing a new first time user experience features to https://app.rewind.io.
Upgrading all applicable components from Rails 5 to Rails 6.
Enhancements to our administrative interface (the one that support, sales, and marketing rely on) to bundle customers, change billing plans, and cancel subscriptions.
Aggregating Webhooks with DynamoDB and SQS Delay Queues
ABOUT YOU
You are a perfect match for this role if you’re someone who possesses:
Great troubleshooting and analytical skills, you’re an exceptional communicator, you have prior experience building or maintaining Javascript and/or Ruby on Rails-based applications, and you have a curious mind for how things work and what makes them tick.
You should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.
You must be proficient in REST and GraphQL APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, and major browser development tools. You should be well-versed in AWS, source control management (preferably Git), Docker, and one of either Ruby or Javascript.
You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Rewind is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

About IronSight
IronSight is the vac truck-turned-software company. We initially built IronSight as an internal tool to dispatch our field team more efficiently and allow our oil and gas clients to send us job requests and track our trucks. In the early days, they jokingly referred to us as the Uber-of-the-oilfield. We eventually decided to sell our trucks and market the software to large energy producers struggling with the same problems we had. Over the years, IronSight has evolved into a platform for intelligent field operations that helps large industrial operations and service providers work more efficiently together.
Our apps take a job through its entire life cycle: from request, to scheduling, to execution, to field ticketing, and finally to analytics. Coordinators have a birds-eye view of workers, tasks, and assets in the field. Several of the world’s largest energy producers are currently using IronSight in partnership with their service providers. Our long-term goal is to transition IronSight into a marketplace that enables cross-organization collaboration. In simple terms, we want energy producers to discover and send jobs to service providers, then track them as they execute the work. We want both parties on this two-sided platform to become more efficient through improved communication, elimination of manual processes, and application of business intelligence and AI/ML to the data collected from the field.

We really value our employees and like to show our appreciation through transparency and authenticity to our core. Great to see you’ve made it this far, now if you want to know more about what your day would look like at TerraSense, keep reading!
*
WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.

...on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms.

You will use your Python / C(++) skills to develop, maintain, optimize, and document MIST code while mentoring your peers and supporting junior developers. You will contribute to our ongoing efforts to build high-functioning DevSecOps and MLOps pipelines, building and enhancing the tools and systems we use to make deployable AI software.
Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a
Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years as well as a criminal record and credit check
.
You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours.
These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.

Accountability: We truly do work hard, play hard and expect everyone to self manage...meaning we don’t track hours.
Flexibility: If your best time to work is from 10pm to 2am, or you have kid drop offs and pickups, then we want to support that! We try to enable team communication by committing to M-Th 10am-2pm “office hours.” The rest is up to you as long as your work is completed.

817,"Software Developer - Kelowna, BC - Indeed.com","CATCHY INTRO
Honestly, we’ve been brainstorming this “catchy intro” for about 20 minutes and everything that we throw at the wall is either too serious, or just downright lame, with no authenticity behind it. Which is absolutely hilarious, considering everyday TerraSense strives for authenticity. So that’s it. That’s what you get. Our not-so-super-catchy, not-super-lame, but not-super-corporate intro. Authentic. Hey, come work here and help us on this journey.
*
WHY WORK WITH US?*
Our two main products target the Utilities and Defense sectors. Besides understanding how to use machine learning to predict maintenance for transmission lines, or how to take the metadata from two sensors and fuse them together, we actually do appreciate the soft skills too. We strive to foster a culture of success, innovation, respect, and did we mention authenticity? That’s right, if you hate what the CTO is saying, we fully expect you to step up and tell him he’s wrong (or that you disagree). The Product Manager does all the time and she still hasn’t been fired.
*
WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING...*
...on the development team for our MIST product, working to create and deploy aerial surveillance with artificial intelligence. The product will utilize edge computing, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. Okay so we hope that you got this far and are slightly intrigued by our culture and what you would be doing. Here comes the hard part. This role requires you to be a
Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident having resided in Canada for at least 10 years.
You will be required to work locally with flexibility on work hours.
These are hard requirements with no negotiation, so please do not apply to this particular role if you don’t meet these requirements. We will have other roles that come up without such stringent requirements, but there is no wiggle room on this one.
*
QUALIFICATIONS*
Minimum 2 years of industry experience with software development
Solid knowledge of Python and C/C++ development
Experience developing & maintaining deployable code
Familiarity with version control (Git) and Agile development
A passion for coding and an interest in machine learning
Experience working with small teams
For soft skills we would like you the most if you were adaptable, creative, multidisciplinary, self-directed
Eligible for security clearance and to work in Canada
Bonus: Experience with technical writing
Bonus: Networking and cybersecurity
COMPENSATION
Signing Bonus
Competitive salary and stock options based on experience, competency and length of service
5 weeks paid vacation

NON - COMPENSATION CONSIDERATIONS
Accountability: We truly do work hard, play hard and expect everyone to self manage...meaning we don’t track hours.
Flexibility: If your best time to work is from 10pm to 2am then we want to support that so we try to enable team communication by committing to M-Th 10am-2pm “office hours.” The rest is up to you.

Zensurance is focused on building a market leading insurance platform that helps small and medium sized businesses manage their business risks. This task requires us to engineer from scratch, a customer-centric organization and product. We are boldly going where no insurance broker has gone before!
Want to touch every part of the SDLC and be a tactical problem solver for all the dynamic challenges found outside the codebase?
Read on…
Are you a big believer in infrastructure as code? Do you love improving the quality of life of software developers? Are you able to build great relationships and communicate new and exciting initiatives? Are you always at the cutting edge of the best developer tooling and best practices for SRE? Do you love learning new things and see every challenge as an opportunity? Have you already had experience spinning up the BEST developer environment and are ready for your next challenge?

The ""no-fluff"" benefits of joining Zensurance
Complex Challenges
: In its current state, the insurance industry can make buying insurance unnecessarily complex. Your challenge would be to take that complexity and make it easy for small and mid-sized businesses to understand and select the right coverage using your development experience in a MERN stack environment.

You will join an environment that believes in strong documentation, commenting on the code, and making things as straightforward as possible without sacrificing code quality and scalability (cutting the right corners).
Everyone Has a Voice
: Your opinion matters; but so does the opinion of anyone else that has insight and data that can add value and strength to our design and code. We strongly believe that you should have strong opinions, but they should be loosely held and open to change when presented with new information.
Passionate People
: You will join an environment where people love to solve problems (small and complex), are excited to share what they have learned, and who push themselves to make the most of their workweek while ACTUALLY maintaining work-life balance.

The ""no-fluff"" benefits of joining Zensurance
Complex Challenges
: In its current state, the insurance industry can make buying insurance unnecessarily complex. Your challenge would be to take that complexity and make it easy for small and mid-sized businesses to understand and select the right coverage using your development experience in a MERN stack environment.
Code is for Humans
: Not only are you coding for our users, but you are also coding for other teams and future teams. You will join an environment that believes in strong documentation, commenting on the code, and making things as straightforward as possible without sacrificing code quality and scalability (cutting the right corners).
Everyone Has a Voice
: Your opinion matters; but so does the opinion of anyone else that has insight and data that can add value and strength to our design and code. We strongly believe that you should have strong opinions, but they should be loosely held and open to change when presented with new information.
Passionate People
: You will join an environment where people love to solve problems (small and complex), are excited to share what they have learned, and who push themselves to make the most of their workweek while ACTUALLY maintaining work-life balance.
Other benefits
We budget 40% of our sprints to technical enhancements
Internal hackathons for you to chase a new solution that you think adds value.
Bi-weekly learning sessions where people from all dev teams can share new ideas, tools, concepts, and solutions.
Training/education/conference budget.
Opportunity for long-term growth within a rapidly expanding company.
Join a diverse team that offers different perspectives and never settles for 'this is just how it's always been done.'
Responsibilities
Collaborate with other Platform Team members as well as the Development team as a whole on their needs.
Evangelize proper SRE principles to the engineering department.
Ensure stability and availability of our production software.
Develop and suggest new ideas for continuous improvement.
Maintain professional and respectful communication with other team members and developers especially when receiving open feedback and off-hour/on-call situations.
Manage and build infrastructure in cloud service providers using industry best practices with a high degree of maintainability and scalability.

During this time of remote learning environment, the PTACs do not have access to Official Files. If there are documents you submitted to your Official File you would like the PTAC to use in the review of your application, you will need to include those documents when applying for positions.
All job postings will be for in-person teaching, unless they are indicated ""OC"" for Online Course or ""Remote"" for remote teaching. OC and Remote teaching is defined below.
Courses created specifically for online instruction have been collaboratively designed by a content expert (normally a faculty member) and an instructional designer and digital media and educational technology specialists. Online course development is guided by instructional design strategies and makes use of pedagogically led technology. Online courses are intentionally developed for instructors and students to be separated by space (location) and/or time (often both).
Remote instruction, as the term is used here, uses technology-enabled tools and software to facilitate course delivery when in-person instruction is not possible in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Remote"" instruction is not directly comparable to ""online course"" instruction. The difference is not in the quality of the content, but in the design of content delivery.

Collaboration and performance at CBC is both a mindset and an approach. At CBC Digital Strategy and Products, we’re people- and outcome-focused. We believe that people are at their best when they have some flexibility in how and where they work. Due to the pandemic, our teams are currently working virtually, on a full-time basis. Once it is safe to do so, we will transition to our hybrid model. This model allows for virtual early- or later-starts, as well as on-site meetings.
Work at CBC/Radio-Canada
At the CBC, we all have a story to tell. What’s yours?
If you share our passion for Canadian storytelling and you wish to help us engage with individuals and communities across our various digital platforms, this is where you’ll want to be!
Every day, you will have an opportunity to shape the way in which Canadians see themselves reflected in our digital services. Your work will have a direct impact on how millions of Canadians from various communities connect with our products, with one another, and with the diverse voices that make our country so unique.
You will have the opportunity to play a part in enlightening and entertaining Canadians through our innovative work in building the mediums that deliver our content.

When you join our mission, you are not only shaping the vision of the CBC, but the future of our country.
Why is this role important?
This isn’t your typical machine learning role. You are taking the best of data systems engineering, machine learning and software development, and applying it to interesting problems you wouldn’t normally get a chance to solve at a big enterprise or a startup.
As a Machine Learning Developer, you’ll be able to apply Machine Learning approaches to products, where the expected outcome is to show value to our audience, rather than to increase company revenue. We have several recommendation systems in production that we actively iterate on. At CBC Digital Products, we tackle the hard problems, while applying the very best solutions to serve the needs of Canadians. For more stories on what we have built and how we use Machine Intelligence at CBC, explore our blog posts on Medium.

Here’s why we should work together:
Our digital teams’ values - collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement - embody who we are as a people-focused, digital-forward employer. We follow lean startup principles and use an Agile approach. Our dedicated people managers work closely with every individual to ensure we are leveraging their strengths, championing their ideas and supporting their pursuit of new skills and their desired career progression.
Here at CBC Digital Strategy & Products, we want you to be happy and feel good at work. It is essential that work be a safe space where our employees are able to share their authentic selves with one another and to push each other to challenge conventions.

You will experiment with machine learning algorithms to create personalized experiences uniquely customized for Canadians.

You will collaborate with individuals, teams and community of practices to ensure the highest quality product is developed and best practices are followed.
You will continuously pursue knowledge through build, measure, learn processes in an Agile environment and stay on top of the latest technology developments.
What you could bring to our team:
The passion for machine learning and data. You like to experiment and explore bleeding edge technologies and techniques, and validate their effectiveness.You are comfortable with the level of ambiguity these new technologies and projects might bring.
The experience. You have strong software development principles and apply them rigorously. To that end, we will be asking you to complete a timed technical assessment. We want to respect your time, evaluate your skills and ensure you have the knowledge that will enable you to thrive and grow in our environment.
The education. A degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or equivalent is preferred, but we know not everyone gains their programming skills this way.
The technical skills. You have strong software development skills in Python and knowledge of machine learning libraries (e.g. Tensorflow). You have an interest in Big Data technologies, NoSQL, ETL and Google Cloud Platform or AWS.

Work at CBC/Radio-Canada
At the CBC, we all have a story to tell. What’s yours?
If you share our passion for Canadian storytelling and you wish to help us engage with individuals and communities across our various digital platforms, this is where you’ll want to be!
Every day, you will have an opportunity to shape the way in which Canadians see themselves reflected in our digital services. Your work will have a direct impact on how millions of Canadians from various communities connect with our products, with one another, and with the diverse voices that make our country so unique.
You will have the opportunity to play a part in enlightening and entertaining Canadians through our innovative work in building the mediums that deliver our content. We are an innovative hub, where the talented professionals we work with are respected and valued for their contributions. Our product teams are vibrant and our work culture strives to achieve the highest standards of diversity and inclusion. We believe that hiring people with different career paths and backgrounds is fundamental in our shared success and in building healthy and highly performant teams. When you join our mission, you are not only shaping the vision of the CBC, but the future of our country.
Why is this role important?
We are in search of an experienced Node.js Developer with hands-on exposure to React, to join us on a short-term contract (with the possibility of extension) to further develop the usability and functionality of an internal Bull job queue engine called BADJAM (Bull Application for Data Jobs and Monitoring).
This CBC built tool is used to take data from one client application (the data source) and port it to another (the data target) when a ready-built or out-of-the-box integration does not exist between two applications. The way the data fields are mapped between the data source and data target is described in the job configuration file itself. Currently, every job in BADJAM requires a new workflow that must be manually configured by a Developer. Your challenge will be to determine the best approach to automating porting jobs with the ultimate goal of levelling up BADJAM into a robust, bonafide internal application that all stakeholders can trust.
The CBC’s digital footprint is one of the largest in Canada. This is an incredible opportunity for someone looking to gain digital product experience at a company that is third only to Facebook and YouTube for data volume in Canada. You will make a powerful and direct impact on our audience of millions by enabling our internal users to optimize and leverage data that improves the audience experience. Furthermore, you will improve the daily work of our internal teams, by building out a self-service feature in BADJAM that will enable non-technical users to complete tasks easily.
We are open to qualified candidates who reside within Canada, but the CBC’s Digital Strategy & Products department is located in Toronto. While we are currently working remotely, the need to be in-office on occasion when it is safe to do so continues to exist.
Here’s why we should work together:
Our digital teams’ values - collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement - embody who we are as a people-focused, digital-forward employer. We follow lean startup principles and use an Agile approach. Our dedicated people managers work closely with every individual to ensure we are leveraging their strengths, championing their ideas and supporting their pursuit of new skills and their desired career progression.
Here at CBC Digital Strategy & Products, we want you to be happy and feel good at work. It is essential that work be a safe space where our employees are able to share their authentic selves with one another and to push each other to challenge conventions.
Perks you can look forward to:
Hybrid work environment with flexible work schedules, allowing you to prioritize yourself, your family and your work (Note: we are fully remote until masks are no longer required to be worn indoors);
Opportunities to work with cutting edge technology;
Opportunities to become a member of our Employee Resource Groups;
Pair programming and mentorship opportunities, where you can learn from the best in the industry and help coach new talent;
A creative and dynamic work environment, where your ideas and contributions can be heard, valued and respected;
A supportive management team committed to upholding the highest standards of diversity and inclusivity;
An environment which favours experimentation and an iterative approach in order to achieve the highest form of technical innovation.
We are looking for a candidate with the following:
How you will make an impact:
You will play a critical role as part of the Audience Activation and Engagement team, with a significant degree of ownership over BADJAM in this next phase of its development. You will:
Review BAMJAM from end-to-end, front-to-back, analyze the system and the way it is used, and determine the approach for function automation.
Work across the tool to build a more robust architecture and framework, increasing scalability, and paving the way for a front-end to be developed for the tool.
What you could bring to our team:
The technical skills. You have two years or more of experience in Node.js and ideally a frontend language such as ReactJS. Exposure to Redis, OpenShift, and containerized applications is a bonus.
The drive. You thrive in an autonomous and ambiguous environment that rejects “business as usual” and fosters innovative problem-solving. You enjoy working with people and sharing your knowledge with them in a collaborative way. You are constantly curious and continuously learning.
The communication skills. You know how to listen and empathize with others. You have excellent verbal and written skills.
The education. We are less interested in formal degrees, while you may have an academic background in Computer Science, we value know-how over theory.
Qualified candidates may be subject to a practical assessment of the above requirements.
All employees of CBC/Radio-Canada are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of
December 1st 2021

Collaboration and performance at CBC is both a mindset and an approach. At CBC Digital Strategy and Products, we’re people- and outcome-focused. We believe that people are at their best when they have some flexibility in how and where they work. Due to the pandemic, our teams are currently working virtually, on a full-time basis. Once it is safe to do so, we will transition to our hybrid model. This model allows for virtual early- or later-starts, as well as on-site meetings.
Work at CBC/Radio-Canada
At the CBC, we all have a story to tell. What’s yours?
If you share our passion for Canadian storytelling and you wish to help us engage with individuals and communities across our various digital platforms, this is where you’ll want to be!
Every day, you will have an opportunity to shape the way in which Canadians see themselves reflected in our digital services. Your work will have a direct impact on how millions of Canadians from various communities connect with our products, with one another, and with the diverse voices that make our country so unique.
You will have the opportunity to play a part in enlightening and entertaining Canadians through our innovative work in building the mediums that deliver our content. We are an innovative hub, where the talented professionals we work with are respected and valued for their contributions. Our product teams are vibrant and our work culture strives to achieve the highest standards of diversity and inclusion. We believe that hiring people with different career paths and backgrounds is fundamental in our shared success and in building healthy and highly performant teams. When you join our mission, you are not only shaping the vision of the CBC, but the future of our country.
Why is this role important?
This isn’t your typical machine learning role. You are taking the best of data systems engineering, machine learning and software development, and applying it to interesting problems you wouldn’t normally get a chance to solve at a big enterprise or a startup.
As a Machine Learning Developer, you’ll be able to apply Machine Learning approaches to products, where the expected outcome is to show value to our audience, rather than to increase company revenue. We have several recommendation systems in production that we actively iterate on. At CBC Digital Products, we tackle the hard problems, while applying the very best solutions to serve the needs of Canadians. For more stories on what we have built and how we use Machine Intelligence at CBC, explore our blog posts on Medium.
As our new Machine Learning Developer, you will be responsible for development and deployment of Machine Learning algorithms, uniquely catered to our various product offerings and content areas, and their success metrics. With direct mentorship from senior members of our Machine Learning practice, this is an exciting opportunity to apply your knowledge and grow your hands-on skills using - and building - the latest tools and technologies.
If you're passionate about Canada and you love technology, learning and bringing out the best in others, you’ll love working at CBC.
Here’s why we should work together:
Our digital teams’ values - collaboration, learning, and continuous improvement - embody who we are as a people-focused, digital-forward employer. We follow lean startup principles and use an Agile approach. Our dedicated people managers work closely with every individual to ensure we are leveraging their strengths, championing their ideas and supporting their pursuit of new skills and their desired career progression.
Here at CBC Digital Strategy & Products, we want you to be happy and feel good at work. It is essential that work be a safe space where our employees are able to share their authentic selves with one another and to push each other to challenge conventions.

Flexible work schedules, allowing you to prioritize yourself, your family and your work

Collaboration and performance at CBC is both a mindset and an approach. At CBC Digital Strategy and Products, we’re people- and outcome-focused. We believe that people are at their best when they have some flexibility in how and where they work. Due to the pandemic, our teams are currently working virtually, on a full-time basis. Once it is safe to do so, we will transition to our hybrid model. This model allows for virtual early- or later-starts, as well as on-site meetings.
Work at CBC/Radio-Canada

As a Machine Learning Developer, you’ll be able to apply Machine Learning approaches to products, where the expected outcome is to show value to our audience, rather than to increase company revenue. We have several recommendation systems in production that we actively iterate on.

We are looking for a candidate with the following:
How you will make an impact:
You will build, Validate, and deploy machine learning solutions that will help us better engage with Canadians.
You will experiment with machine learning algorithms to create personalized experiences uniquely customized for Canadians.
You will help iterate on our machine learning infrastructure to ensure it continues to be robust and scalable.
You will collaborate with individuals, teams and community of practices to ensure the highest quality product is developed and best practices are followed.
You will continuously pursue knowledge through build, measure, learn processes in an Agile environment and stay on top of the latest technology developments.
What you could bring to our team:
The passion for machine learning and data. You like to experiment and explore bleeding edge technologies and techniques, and validate their effectiveness.You are comfortable with the level of ambiguity these new technologies and projects might bring.

We want to respect your time, evaluate your skills and ensure you have the knowledge that will enable you to thrive and grow in our environment.
The education. A degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Math, or equivalent is preferred, but we know not everyone gains their programming skills this way.

1097,"Full Stack Developer - Victoria, BC - Indeed.com","OneFeather is looking for a Developer to join our team in Canada. You'll report to our Lead Developer and work closely with the rest of the product team to deliver high quality, working software that meets the needs of our customers.
We are a small, fully remote team in a fast-moving start up. You'll fit in well if you want the experience of working in at a lot of different areas of the development stack (frontend to infrastructure) and you feel strongly about putting the needs of our customers first.
As an engineering team, we invest in our team through knowledge sharing, pair programming, and internal education. Software development can be a lifelong career (if that's what you want), not just an on-ramp to a career in management and we want to see you grow and challenge yourself in your time with us.
We're looking for someone who is aligned with the values of our engineering team and wants to contribute to a meaningful product that looks to decolonize the Indigenous experience in Canada.
This role is open to candidates who are authorized to work in Canada and currently live in Canada. Our team is remote-first and we connect using Basecamp, Zendesk, MS Teams, and other tools.
*About the role
*
As a developer with OneFeather, you'll have the opportunity to contribute to many areas of the software development lifecycle – building features, writing tests, fixing bugs, writing documentation, improving processes, prioritizing issues, etc.
*In the first three months, you'll:
*
- Onboard to our tech stack and product roadmap
- Contribute to our codebase, writing readable, performant code
- Deploy your code contributions to production
- Ensure that your code has automated tests that work with our CI/CD pipeline to maintain the reliability we expect in our platform
- Actively contribute to product planning sessions with the team
- Help with QA and testing of new and existing features
- Participate in code reviews and collaborative design practices
*In the first 12 months, you'll:
*
- Deliver technical projects from start to finish
- Work closely with the team to coordinate feature releases
- Experiment with creative solutions and innovative technologies to create exceptional customer experiences
- Collaborate with your team lead on project planning
- Contribute to our standards of technical documentation to support our commitment to building scalable systems
- Ensure that customer feedback is taken into consideration during any/all feature planning
*Relevant Technical Knowledge
*
We have two codebases in Rails and Phoenix deployed to Heroku and AWS via CI/CD pipelines.
Familiarity with the following technologies is not necessary but will help you hit the ground running.
- Elixir, Ruby, TypeScript
- Phoenix, Rails, RSpec, GraphQL, Alpine.js, React, TailwindCSS, Webpack
- PostgreSQL, Redis
- AWS, Docker, Terraform
- Git, CI, CD
- Figma
*About you
*
You are someone who cares about doing high quality, customer focused work, and wants to improve your craft over time. For us, this means that you bring a desire to learn and improve your skills as a software developer (it doesn't mean spending every spare minute on side projects).
You can manage your own time and prioritize the work that needs to be done. We're here to support you but being a part of a remote team means that we trust you to take ownership of your work and see your projects through to completion.
*About OneFeather
*
OneFeather is an Indigenous owned company headquartered in Victoria, BC. We provide products and services for First Nations and Indigenous People. Currently, we support 200+ nations and over 30,000 individuals above the medicine line (in Canada). We offer online Status Card applications, digital voting and community management tools, and a mobile wallet.
We're looking for someone who is aligned with OneFeather’s values and wants to work with a meaningful product that seeks to decolonize the Indigenous experience in Canada.
We offer competitive salary & benefits, three weeks' vacation, a professional development budget, flexible remote-first work, a 4-day work week after one year of employment, and an impactful product.

At OneFeather, we believe that a diverse, inclusive company is a strong company.

Work with the Quality Engineering team to ensure projects are tested correctly
Guide new processes and procedures in the solutions space to improve the quality, consistency, and automation of releases

Review and manage access to our tools and infrastructure.
